<span class="small">HOW FLORENCE GOT HER NAME&mdash;HER THREE
HOMES.</span></h2>


<p>One evening, some time after the great
Crimean War of 1854-55, a company of
military and naval officers met at dinner
in London. They were talking over the
war, as soldiers and sailors love to do, and somebody
said: "Who, of all the workers in the Crimea,
will be longest remembered?"</p>

<p>Each guest was asked to give his opinion on this
point, and each one wrote a name on a slip of paper.
There were many slips, but when they came to be
examined there was only one name, for every single
man had written "Florence Nightingale."</p>

<p>Every English boy and girl knows the beautiful
story of Miss Nightingale's life. Indeed, hers is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
perhaps the best-loved name in England since good
Queen Victoria died. It will be a great pleasure to
me to tell this story to our own boys and girls in this
country; and it shall begin, as all proper stories do,
at the beginning.</p>

<p>Her father was named William Nightingale. He
was an English gentleman, and in the year 1820
was living in Italy with his wife. Their first child
was born in Naples, and they named her Parthenope,
that being the ancient name of Naples; two
years later, when they were living in Florence, another
little girl came to them, and they decided to
name her also after the city of her birth.</p>

<p>When Florence was still a very little child her
parents came back to England to live, bringing the
two children with them. First they went to a house
called Lea Hall, in Derbyshire. It was an old, old
house of gray stone, standing on a hill, in meadows
full of buttercups and clover. All about were blossoming
hedgerows full of wild roses, and great
elder-bushes heavy with white blossoms; and on the
hillside below it lies the quaint old village of Lea
with its curious little stone houses.</p>

<p>Lea Hall is a farmhouse now, but it still has its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
old flag-paved hall and its noble staircase of oak
with twisted balustrade, and broad solid steps where
little Florence and her sister "Parthe" used to play
and creep and tumble. There was another place
near by where they loved even better to play; that
was the ancient house of Dethick. I ought rather
to say the ancient kitchen, for little else remained
of the once stately mansion. The rest of the house
was comparatively new, but the great kitchen was
(and no doubt is) much as it was in the days of
Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Imagine a great room with heavy timbered roof,
ponderous oaken doors, and huge open fireplace over
which hung the ancient roasting jack. In the ceiling
was a little trap-door, which looked as if it might
open on the roof; but in truth it was the entrance to
a chamber hidden away under the roof, a good-sized
room, big enough for several persons to hide in.</p>

<p>Florence and her sister loved to imagine the
scenes that had taken place in that old kitchen;
strange and thrilling, perhaps terrible scenes; they
knew the story of Dethick, and now you shall hear
it too.</p>

<p>In that old time which Tennyson calls "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
spacious days of great Elizabeth," Dethick belonged
to a noble family named Babington. It was a fine
house then. The oaken door of the old kitchen
opened on long corridors and passages, which in
turn led to stately halls and noble galleries. There
were turrets and balconies overlooking beautiful
gardens; and on the stone terraces gay lords and
ladies used to walk and laugh and make merry,
and little children run and play and dance, and life
go on very much as it does now, with work and
play, love and laughter and tears.</p>

<p>One of the gay people who used to walk there
was Anthony Babington. He was a gallant young
gentleman, an ardent Catholic, and devoted to the
cause of the beautiful and unfortunate Mary Queen
of Scots.</p>

<p>Though ardent and devoted, Babington was a
weak and foolish young man. He fell under the influence
of a certain Ballard, an artful and designing
person who had resolved to bring about the
death of the great English Queen, and was induced
by him to form the plot which is known in history
as Babington's Conspiracy; so he was brought to
ruin and death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1586 Queen Mary was imprisoned
at Wingfield Manor, a country house only a few
miles distant from Dethick. The conspirators gathered
other Catholic noblemen about them, and
planned to release Queen Mary and set her once
more on the throne.</p>

<p>They used to meet at Dethick where, it is said,
there is a secret passage underground leading to
Wingfield Manor. Perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;they
may have sat in the kitchen, gathering about the
great fireplace for warmth; the lights out, for fear
of spies, only the firelight gleaming here and there,
lighting up the dark corners and the eager, intent
faces. And when the plot was discovered, and
Queen Elizabeth's soldiers were searching the country
round for the young conspirators, riding hither
and thither along the pleasant country lanes and
thrusting their sabres in among the blossoming
hedgerows, it was here at Dethick that they
sought for Anthony Babington. They did not find
him, for he was in hiding elsewhere, but one of
his companions was actually discovered and arrested
there.</p>

<p>Perhaps&mdash;again, who knows?&mdash;this man may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
have been hiding in the secret chamber above the
trap-door. One can fancy the pursuers rushing in,
flinging open cupboards and presses, in search for
their prey; and finding no one, gathering baffled
around the fireplace. Then one, chancing to glance
up, catches sight of the trap-door in the ceiling.
"Ha! lads, look up! the rascal may be hiding yonder!
Up with you, you tall fellow!" Then a piling
up of benches, one man mounting on another's
shoulders&mdash;the door forced open, the young nobleman
seized and overpowered, and brought down to
be carried off to London for trial.</p>

<p>Anthony Babington and his companions were executed
for high treason, and Queen Mary, who was
convicted of approving the plot, was put to death
soon after.</p>

<p>All this Florence Nightingale and her sister knew,
and they never tired of "playing suppose" in old
Dethick kitchen, and living over again in fancy the
romantic time long past. And on Sundays the two
children went with their parents to old Dethick
church, and sat where Anthony Babington used to
sit, for in his days it was the private chapel of
Dethick. It is a tiny church; fifty people would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
fill it to overflowing, but Florence and her sister
might easily feel that the four bare walls held all
the wild history of Elizabeth's reign.</p>

<p>Anthony Babington in doublet and hose, with
velvet mantle, feathered cap, and sword by his side;
little Florence Nightingale in round Leghorn hat
and short petticoats. It is a long step between these
two, yet they are the two most famous people who
ever said their prayers in old Dethick church. The
lad's brief and tragic story contrasts strangely with
the long and beautiful story of Florence Nightingale,
a story that has no end.</p>

<p>When Florence was between five and six years
old, she left Lea Hall for a new home, Lea Hurst,
about a mile distant. Here her father had built a
beautiful house in the Elizabethan style, of stone,
with pointed gables, mullioned windows and latticed
panes. There was a tiny chapel on the site
he chose, hundreds of years old, and this he built
into the house, so that Lea Hurst, as well as Lea
Hall and Dethick, joined hands with the old historic
times. In this little chapel, by and by, we
shall see Florence holding her Bible class. But I
like still to think of her as a little rosy girl, running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
about the beautiful gardens of Lea Hurst, or playing
house in the quaint old summerhouse with
its pointed roof of thatch. Perhaps she brought her
dolls here; but the dolls must wait for another
chapter.</p>

<p>Soon after moving to Lea Hurst, the Nightingales
bought still another country seat, Embley
Park, in Hampshire, a fine old mansion built in
Queen Elizabeth's time, and at some distance from
Lea Hurst.</p>

<p>After this the family used to spend the summer
at Lea Hurst, and the winter at Embley. There
were no railroads then in that neighborhood; the
journey was sometimes made by stagecoach, sometimes
in the Nightingales' own carriage.</p>

<p>Embley Park is one of the stately homes of England,
with its lofty gables, terraces and shadowing
trees; and all around it are sunny lawns, and gardens
filled with every sweet and lovely flower.</p>

<p>Now you know a little of the three homes of
Florence Nightingale, Lea Hall, Lea Hurst, and
Embley Park; next you shall hear what kind of
child she herself was.</p>

<span class="small">LITTLE FLORENCE.</span></h2>


<p>All the boys, and very likely some of the
girls, who have got as far as this second
chapter, will glance down the page,
and exclaim: "<i>Dolls!</i>" Then they will
add whatever is their favorite expression of scorn,
and perhaps make a motion to lay the book down.</p>

<p>Wait a moment, girls, and boys too! I advise
you to read on, and see what came in this case of
playing with dolls.</p>

<p>There were a good many thousands of boys in
England at that time, in the Twenties and Thirties,
who might have been badly off when the terrible
Fifties came, if Florence Nightingale had not
played with her dolls. Read on, and see for yourselves!</p>

<p>Florence Nightingale loved her dolls dearly, and
took the greatest possible care of them; and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
they were always delicate and given to sudden and
alarming illnesses. A doll never knew when she
might be told that she was very ill, and undressed
and put to bed, though she might but just have
got on her new frock. Then Mamma Florence
would wait upon her tenderly, smoothing her pillow,
bathing her forehead or rubbing her poor back,
and bringing her all kinds of good things in the
doll-house dishes. The doll might feel very much
better the next day, and think it was time to get up
and put on the new frock again; but she was very
apt to have a relapse and go back to bed and gruel
again, once at least, before she was allowed to recover
entirely.</p>

<p>The truth is, Florence was born to be a nurse, and
a sick doll was dearer to her than a strong and
healthy one. So I fear her dolls would have been
invalids most of the time if it had not been for
Parthenope's little family, who often required their
Aunt Florence's care. These dolls were very unlucky,
or else their mamma was very careless; you
can call it whichever you like. They were always
tumbling down and breaking their heads, or losing
arms and legs, or burning themselves at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
nursery fire, or suffering from doll's consumption,
that dreadful complaint otherwise known as loss
of sawdust. When these things happened, Aunt
Florence was called in as a matter of course;
and she set the fractures, and salved the burns, and
stopped the flow of sawdust, and proved herself
in every way a most skillful nursery surgeon and
physician.</p>

<p>So it was that unconsciously, and in play, Florence
began her training for her life work. She was having
lessons, of course; arithmetic, and all the other
proper things. She and Parthe had a governess,
and studied regularly, and had music and drawing
lessons besides; and her father taught her to
love English literature, and later opened to her the
great doors marked <i>Latin</i> and <i>Greek</i>. Her mother,
meantime, taught her all kinds of handiwork, and
before she was twelve years old she could hemstitch,
and seam and embroider. These things were
all good, and very good; without them she could
not have accomplished all she did; but in the years
that were to come all the other learning was going
to help that wonderful learning that began with
nursing the sick dolls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon she was to take another step in her profession.
The little fingers grown so skillful by bandaging
waxen and china arms and legs, were now to
save a living, loving creature from death.</p>

<p>To every English child this story is a nursery
tale. No doubt it is to many American children
also, yet it is one that no one can ever tire of hearing,
so I shall tell it again.</p>

<p>Much as Florence loved dolls, she loved animals
better, and in her country homes she was surrounded
by them. There was her dog, who hardly left her
side when she was out of doors; there was her
own pony on which she rode every day over dale
and down; her sister's pony, too, and old Peggy,
who was too old to work, and lived in a pleasant
green paddock with nothing to do but amuse herself
and crop grass all day long. Perhaps Peggy
found this tiresome, for whenever she saw Florence
at the gate she would toss her head and whinny
and come trotting up to the gate. "Good morning,
Peggy!" Florence would say. "Would you
like an apple?"</p>

<p>"Hooonh!" Peggy would say. (Horses have
no spelling books, and there is no exact rule as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
how a whinny should be spelled. You may try any
other way that looks to you more natural.)</p>

<p>"Then look for it!" Florence would reply. At
this Peggy would sniff and snuff, and hunt round
with her soft velvety nose till she found Florence's
pocket, then delicately take out the apple and crunch
it up, and whinny again, the second whinny meaning
at once "Thank you!" and "More, please!"
Horse language is a simple one compared to English,
and has no grammar.</p>

<p>Well, one day Florence was riding her pony in
company with her friend the vicar. This good man
loved all living creatures, but there were few dearer
to him than Florence Nightingale. They had the
same tastes and feelings. Both loved to help and
comfort all who were "in trouble, sorrow, need,
sickness, or any other adversity." He had studied
medicine before he became a clergyman, and so was
able to tell her many things about the care of the
sick and injured. Here was another teacher. I
suppose everyone we know could teach us something
good, if we were ready to learn.</p>

<p>As I said, Florence and the vicar were riding
along on the green downs; and here I must stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
again a moment to tell you what the downs are,
for when I was a child I used to wonder. They
are great rounded hills, covered with close, thick
turf, like a velvet carpet. They spread in long
smooth green billows, miles and miles of them, the
slopes so gentle that it is delightful to drive or
ride on them; only you must be careful not to go
near the edge, where the green breaks off suddenly,
and a white chalk cliff goes down, down, hundreds
of feet, to the blue sea tossing and tumbling below.
These are the white cliffs of England that
you have so often read about.</p>

<p>Am I never going on with the story? Yes; have
patience! there is plenty of time.</p>

<p>There were many sheep on the downs, and there
was one special flock that Florence knew very well.
It belonged to old Roger, a shepherd, who had often
worked for her father. Roger and his good dog
Cap were both friends of Florence's, and she was
used to seeing them on the downs, the sheep in a
more or less orderly compact flock, Cap guarding
them and driving back any stragglers who went
nibbling off toward the cliff edge.</p>

<p>But to-day there seemed no order anywhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
The sheep were scattered in twos and threes, straying
hither and thither; and old Roger alone was
trying to collect them, and apparently having a hard
time of it.</p>

<p>The vicar saw his trouble, and rode up to him.
"What is the matter, Roger?" he asked kindly.
"Where is your dog?"</p>

<p>"The boys have been throwing stones at him,
sir," replied the old man. "They have broken his
leg, poor beast, and he will never be good for anything
again. I shall have to take a bit of cord and
put an end to his misery."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Florence, who had ridden up with
the vicar. "Poor Cap! Are you sure his leg is
broken, Roger?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss, it's broke sure enough. He hasn't
set foot to the ground since, and no one can't go
anigh him but me. Best put him out of his pain,
I says."</p>

<p>"No! no!" cried Florence. "Not till we have
tried to help him. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"He's in the cottage, Missy, but you can do nothing
for him, you'll find. Poor Cap's days is over.
Ah; he were a good dog. Do everything but speak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
he could, and went as near to that as a dumb beast
could. I'll never get another like him."</p>

<p>While the old man lamented, Florence was looking
eagerly in the face of the clergyman. He met
her look with a smile and nod.</p>

<p>"We will go and see!" he said; and off they
rode, leaving Roger shaking his head and calling
to the sheep.</p>

<p>They soon reached the cottage. The door was
fastened, and when they tried to open it a furious
barking was heard within. A little boy came from
the next cottage, bringing the key, which Roger had
left there. They entered, and there lay Cap on the
brick floor, helpless and weak, but still barking as
hard as he could at what he supposed to be intruders.
When he saw Florence and the little boy
he stopped barking, and wagged his tail feebly; then
he crawled from under the table where he lay,
dragged himself to Florence's feet and looked up
pitifully in her face. She knelt down by him, and
soothed and petted and talked to him, while the good
clergyman examined the injured leg. It was dreadfully
swollen, and every touch was painful; but Cap
knew well enough that the hands that hurt were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
trying to help him, and though he moaned and
winced, he licked the hands and made no effort to
draw the leg away.</p>

<p>"Is it broken?" asked Florence anxiously.
"No," said the vicar. "No bones are broken.
There's no reason why Cap should not recover; all
he needs is care and nursing."</p>

<p>Florence quietly laid down her riding whip and
tucked up her sleeves. "What shall I do first?"
she said.</p>

<p>"Well," said the vicar, "I think a hot compress
is the thing." Florence looked puzzled; the dolls
had never had hot compresses. "What is it?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Just a cloth wrung out in boiling water and laid
on, changing it as it cools. Very simple, you see,
Nurse Florence! The first thing is to light the fire."</p>

<p>That was soon done, with the aid of the boy,
who hovered about, interested, but ignorant of surgery.
On went the kettle, and soon it was boiling
merrily; but where were the cloths for the compresses?
Florence looked all about the room, but
could see nothing save Roger's clean smock frock
which hung against the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"This will do!" she cried. "Mamma will give
him another."</p>

<p>The vicar nodded approval. Quickly she tore the
frock into strips of suitable width and length; bade
the boy fill a basin from the kettle, and then
kneeling down beside the wounded dog, Florence
Nightingale for the first time gave "first aid to the
wounded."</p>

<p>As the heat drew out the inflammation and pain,
Cap looked up at the little helper, all his simple dog
heart shining in his eyes; the look sank into the
child's heart and deepened the tenderness already
there. Another step, and a great one, was taken
on the blessed road she was to travel.</p>

<p>Florence came again the next day to bandage
the leg; Cap got entirely well, and tended sheep for
many a year after that; and old Roger was very
grateful, and Mrs. Nightingale gave him a new
smock frock, and everyone was happy; and that is
the end of the story.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

<span class="small">THE SQUIRE'S DAUGHTER.</span></h2>


<p>It soon became a recognized thing in
Florence's own home and in all the
neighborhood, that she was one of the
Sisters of Mercy. Nothing was too
small, no creature too humble to awaken her sympathy
and tenderness. When the stable cat had kittens,
Florence was the first to visit them, to fondle
the tiny creatures and soothe their mother's angry
fear. When she walked along the pleasant wood
roads of Lea Hurst, the squirrels expected nuts as
a matter of course, and could hardly wait for her
to give them. When anyone in the village or farm
fell ill, it was Florence who was looked for to cheer
and comfort. Mrs. Nightingale was a most kind
and charitable lady, and delighted in sending delicacies
to the sick. It was Florence's happy privilege
to carry them, and whether she walked or rode there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
was apt to be a basket on her arm or fastened to
her saddlebow.</p>

<p>If you think hard, you can see&mdash;at least I can&mdash;just
how it would be. Old Goody Brown's rheumatism,
let us say, was very bad one morning. You
children who read this know little about rheumatism.
Very likely you think it rather a funny word,
and that it is just a thing that old people have, and
that they make a good deal of fuss about. If
it were a toothache, now, you say, or colic&mdash;but
the truth is, no pain is in any way pleasant. If a
red-hot sword were run into your back you would
not like it? Well, sometimes rheumatism is like
that.</p>

<p>So old Goody Brown was suffering, and very
cross, just as we might be; and nothing suited her,
poor old soul; her tea was too hot, and her porridge
too cold, and her pillow set askew, and&mdash;dear! dear!
dear! she wished she was dead, so she did. Martha,
her good patient daughter, was at her wits' ends.</p>

<p>"Send to the 'All'!" said poor old Goody.
"Send for Miss Florence! She'll do something for
me, I know."</p>

<p>So a barefoot boy would trudge up to the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
house, and very soon a light, slight figure would
come quickly along the village street and enter the
cottage. A slender girl, quietly dressed, with perfect
neatness and taste; brown hair smoothly parted,
shining like satin; gray-blue eyes full of light and
thoughtfulness; regular features, an oval face,
cheeks faintly tinted with rose&mdash;this was Florence
Nightingale.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you just what she had in the little
basket on her arm, whether jelly or broth or chicken
or oranges; there was sure to be something good
beside the liniment and medicines to help the aching
back and limbs. But the basket held the least
of what she brought. At the very sound of her
voice the fretful lines melted away from the poor
old face. I cannot tell you&mdash;I wish I could&mdash;the
words she said, this little Sister of Mercy, yet I can
almost hear her speak, in that sweet, cordial voice
whose range held no harsh note; can see her setting
the pillow straight and smooth, making the little
tray dainty and pretty with the posy she had
brought, coaxing the old woman to eat, making her
laugh over some story of her pets and their droll
ways. Perhaps before leaving she would open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
worn Bible or prayer book, and read a psalm; can
you not see her sitting by the bedside, her pretty
head bent over the book, her face full of tenderness
and reverence? I am sure that when she went
away there was peace and comfort in that cottage
room, and that heartfelt blessings followed the "Angel
Child" as she went on her homeward way.
"She had a way with her," they said; and that
meant more than volumes of praise.</p>

<p>The flowers that Florence used to carry were
from her own garden, I like to think. Both at
Lea Hurst and Embley, she and her sister had
each her own little garden and gardening tools.
Florence was a good gardener; indeed, I think she
was a good everything that she tried to be, just
because she tried. She dug, and sowed, and
watered, pruned and tied up and did all the things
a garden needs; and so her garden was full of
flowers all summer long, giving delight to her and
to every sick or lonely or sorrowful person for
miles around.</p>

<p>As Florence and her sister grew older they became
more and more helpful to their parents in the
good works that they both loved to carry on. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
have read a delightful account of the "feast day"
of the village school-children, as it used to be given
at Lea Hurst when Florence was a girl.</p>

<p>The children gathered together at the school-house,
all in their best frocks and pinafores, and
walked in procession up the street and through the
fields to Lea Hurst. Each child carried a posy and
a stick wreathed with flowers, and at the head of
the procession marched a band of music, provided
by the good squire. In the field below the garden
tables were set, and here Mrs. Nightingale and her
daughters, aided by the servants, served tea and
buns and cakes, waiting on their little guests, and
seeing that every child got all he wanted&mdash;or at
least all that was good for him. Then when all
had eaten and drunk their fill, the band struck up,
and the boys and girls danced on the green to their
hearts' content.</p>

<p>What did they dance? Polkas, perhaps, and the
redowa, a pretty round dance with a good deal of
stamping in it; and of course Sir Roger de Coverley,
which is very like our Virginia Reel. (If you do
not know about Sir Roger de Coverley himself,
ask papa to tell you or read you about him, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
is one of the pleasantest persons you will ever
know.)</p>

<p>Perhaps they sang, too; perhaps they sang the
pretty old Maypole Song. Do you know it?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come lasses and lads, get leave of your dads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And away to the Maypole hie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ev'ry fair has a sweetheart there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fiddler's standing by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Willy shall dance with Jane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Johnny has got his Joan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To trip it, trip it, trip it, trip it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trip it up and down.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You're out!" says Dick, "not I," says Nick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Twas the fiddler play'd it wrong."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis true," says Hugh, and so says Sue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so says ev'ry one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fiddler then began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To play the tune again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ev'ry girl did trip it, trip it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trip it to the men.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then when feast and dance and song were all
over, it was time to reform the procession and take
up the homeward march. The two sisters, Florence
and Parthe, had disappeared during the dancing;
but now, as the procession passed along the terrace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
there they were, standing behind a long
table; a table at sight of which the children's
eyes grew round and bright, for it was covered
from end to end with presents. Such delightful
presents! Books, and pretty boxes and baskets,
thimble-cases and needle-books and pin-cushions;
dolls, too, I am sure, for the little ones, and scrap-books,
and&mdash;but you can fill up the list for yourself
with everything you like best in the way of
pretty, simple, useful gifts. I am quite sure that
Florence would not have wished to give the children
foolish or elaborate gimcracks, and that Mr.
Nightingale would never have allowed it if she had;
and I think it probable that many of the gifts were
made by the two sisters and their kind and clever
mother.</p>

<p>All about Lea Hurst, in many and many a pleasant
cottage home, those little gifts are treasured
to-day like the relics of some blessed saint; which
indeed is just what they are. The saint is still living,
and some of the children of the school feasts
are living, too, and now in their age will show with
pride and joy the gifts they received long ago from
the hands of the beloved Miss Florence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>As Florence grew up to womanhood she found
more and more work to do. There were mills and
factories in the neighborhood of Lea Hurst; and
in the hosiery mills, especially, hundreds of women
and girls were employed, many of whom lived on
the Nightingale estate.</p>

<p>She may have been seventeen or eighteen when
she started her Bible class for the young women
of the district, holding it in the tiny ancient chapel
at Lea Hurst which I described in the first chapter.
Gathering the girls around her, she would read
a chapter from the Bible, and then give them her
thoughts about it, and explain the difficult passages;
then they would all sing together, her sweet, clear
voice leading the hymns. Here is another memory
very precious to the old women who were once those
happy girls. They love to tell "how beautifully
Miss Florence used to talk."</p>

<p>Long years after, when Miss Nightingale, spent
with her noble labors, would come to Lea Hurst
for a time of rest and refreshment, the daughters
of these girls counted it a high privilege to gather
on the lawn under her window and sing to her as
she sat in the room above; and would go home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
proud and happy as queens if they had seen the
saintly face smiling from the window.</p>

<p>Shall I try to show you Florence Nightingale
at seventeen? Her face was little changed from that
of the girl we saw in the cottage, cheering old
Goody Brown. She still wore her hair brushed
smoothly "Madonna-wise" on either side her face;
often, now, she wore a rose at the side, tucked in
among the shining braids or coils. You would
think her frocks very queer if you saw them to-day,
but then they were extremely pretty; full
skirts (no crinoline! that was to come later) and
full sleeves, with broad flat collar of lace or embroidery.
When she went to church or to make visits
she wore a spencer, a kind of full plaited jacket
with a belt, something like a Norfolk jacket&mdash;only
different! and a Leghorn bonnet. You have seen
pictures of the Leghorn bonnets of the Thirties and
Forties; "coal-scuttles," some people called them,
and they were something the shape of a scuttle.
Some of them were enormous in size, and they
look queer enough now in the pictures, or&mdash;if your
grandmamma had a way of keeping things&mdash;in the
"dress-up" trunk or cupboard in the attic. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
people who were young in those days tell me that
they were extremely becoming, and that a pretty
face never looked prettier that when it peeped out
from the depths of a huge straw "coal-scuttle."</p>

<p>When Florence rode on horseback, her habit was
so long that it nearly touched the ground (that is,
if she followed the fashion of the day, but I should
not wonder a bit if she and her mother were too
sensible!) and she wore a round, broad-brimmed
hat with long ostrich plumes. I remember a picture
of the Princess Royal (afterwards Empress
Frederick of Germany), in a costume like this,
which I thought one of the most beautiful things
I ever saw, so I shall imagine Florence, on an afternoon
ride with the squire, let us say, dressed in
this way; but when scampering about on her pony,
I trust, she wore a less cumbrous costume.</p>

<p>You will remember that the Nightingales spent
the winter at Embley Park, in Hampshire. Here,
too, Florence was busy in good and helpful work.
At Christmas time she found her best pleasure in
giving presents to young and old among the poor
people about her, in getting up entertainments for
the children, training them to sing, arranging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
treats for the old people in the poorhouse. On
Christmas Eve the village carol singers would come
and sing on the lawn; old English carols, that had
been sung by generation after generation. Poor Anthony
Babington over at Lea Hall may have listened
on Christmas Eve to the same sweet old songs.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Then who so glad as Florence to call the singers
in and bid them welcome and "Merry Christmas!"
and aid in distributing the mince pies and silver
coins which were always their due.</p>

<p>When Florence was fairly "grown up," other
things came into her life, the gay and merry things
that come to so many girls. Mr. Nightingale was
a man of wealth and position, and liked his wife
and daughters to have their share in the gayeties
of the county. So there were many parties, at
Embley and elsewhere, and Florence danced as
gayly, I doubt not, as the other girls. She went
to London, too, and she and her sister were presented
to Queen Victoria, and had their share of the
brilliant society of the time.</p>

<p>But much as she may have enjoyed all this for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
a time, still her heart was not in it, and she soon
tired, I fancy, of dancing and dressing and visiting.
Already her mind was turning to other things,
already her clear eyes were looking forward to
other ways of life, other methods of work.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />

<span class="small">LOOKING OUT.</span></h2>


<p>Step by step, and all unconsciously, Florence
Nightingale had been training her
hand and eye to follow the dictates of
her keen mind and loving heart. Now,
grown a young woman, she began to think seriously
how she should apply this training. What
should she do with her life? Should she go on
like her friends, in the quiet pleasant ways of country
life? The squire's daughter was busy enough,
surely. Every hour of the day was full of useful,
kindly work, of happy, healthy play; should
she be content with this? Her heart told her that
she was not content. In her friendly visiting among
the sick poor she had seen much misery and suffering,
far more than she and all the other kindly
ladies could attempt to relieve. She felt that something
more was needed; she began to look around
to see what was being done in the larger world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>It was about this time that she met Elizabeth
Fry, the noble and beautiful friend of the prisoner.
Mrs. Fry was then an elderly woman, with all the
glory of her saintly life shining about her; Florence
Nightingale an earnest and thoughtful girl of perhaps
eighteen or twenty. It is pleasant to think of
that meeting. I do not know what words passed
between them, but I can almost see them together,
the beautiful stately woman in her Quaker dress,
the slender girl with her quiet face and earnest eyes;
can almost hear the young voice, questioning, eager
and ardent; the elder answering, grave and sedate,
words full of weight and wisdom, of sweetness and
tenderness. This interview was one of the great
moments of Florence Nightingale's early life.</p>

<p>A little later than this, in 1843, she met another
person whose words and counsel impressed her
deeply; and of this meeting I can give you a clearer
account, for that person was my own dear father,
Dr. Samuel G. Howe. Some ten years before this
my father had decided to devote his life to helping
people who needed help. He had established a
school for the blind in Boston; he had brought
Laura Bridgman, the blind, deaf mute, out of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
loneliness and taught her to read, write, and talk
with her fingers; the first time this had ever been
done with a person so afflicted. He had labored
to help the prisoners and captives in the North, and
the slaves in the South; in short he was what is
called a <i>philanthropist</i>, that is, one who loves his
fellow-men and tries to help them.</p>

<p>My father and mother were traveling in England
soon after their marriage, and were invited
by Mr. and Mrs. Nightingale to spend a few days
at Embley Park. One morning Miss Nightingale
(for so I must call her now that she is a woman)
met my father in the garden and said to him:</p>

<p>"Dr. Howe, you have had much experience in
the world of philanthropy; you are a medical man
and a gentleman; now may I ask you to tell me,
upon your word, whether it would be anything unsuitable
or unbecoming to a young Englishwoman,
if she should devote herself to works of charity, in
hospitals and elsewhere, as the Catholic Sisters
do?"</p>

<p>My father replied: "My dear Miss Florence, it
would be unusual, and in England whatever is unusual
is apt to be thought unsuitable; but I say to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
you, go forward, if you have a vocation for that
way of life; act up to your aspiration, and you
will find that there is never anything unbecoming
or unladylike in doing your duty for the good of
others. Choose your path, go on with it, wherever
it may lead you, and God be with you!"</p>

<p>It was in this spirit that Miss Nightingale now
began to train herself for her life work.</p>

<p>It is hard for you children of to-day to imagine
what nursing was in the early part of the nineteenth
century. To you a nurse means a trim, alert,
cheerful person in spotless raiment, who knows just
what to do when you are ill, and does it in the
pleasantest possible manner; you are glad when she
comes into the room, sorry when she leaves. But
this pleasant person did not exist in those days,
except in the guise of a Catholic Sister of Charity.
The other nurses were for the most part coarse and
ignorant women, often cruel, often intemperate.
When you read "Martin Chuzzlewit" you will
find out more about them than I can tell you. But
"Martin Chuzzlewit" was not written when Miss
Nightingale determined to find out the condition
of nursing in England and on the Continent. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
first spent some months in the London hospitals,
and then visited those in Scotland and Ireland. She
was horrified at what she found there; dirt and
misery and needless suffering among the patients,
drunkenness and ignorance and brutality among
the nurses. Then she turned to the Continent and
found a very different state of things. The hospitals
were clean and cheerful, and the Sisters of
Mercy in their white caps and aprons were as good
and kind and capable as our trained nurses to-day.</p>

<p>Up to this time these good sisters had been the
only trained nurses in Europe; but in Germany
Miss Nightingale found a Protestant sisterhood
which was working along the same lines, and in a
more enlightened and modern way; these were the
Deaconesses of Kaiserswerth, the pupils of Pastor
Fliedner.</p>

<p>This good man&mdash;one of the best men, surely,
that ever lived&mdash;was the son of a Lutheran minister.
His father was poor, and Theodore had to work
his way through college, but this he did cheerfully,
for he loved work. He studied very hard and also
gave lessons, sawed wood, blacked boots, and did
other odd jobs. When his clothes began to wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
out he sewed up the holes with white thread, all
he had, and then inked it over. He loved children,
and on the long tramps he used to take in
vacation time he was always collecting songs and
games, and teaching them to the children.</p>

<p>When he was twenty-two years old Theodore
Fliedner became pastor of a small Protestant parish
at Kaiserswerth on the Rhine. The people were so
poor that they could do little either for their church
or themselves, so the young pastor set out on foot
to seek aid from other Christian people. He traveled
in Germany, Holland and England, and everywhere
people felt his goodness and gave him help.
In London he met Elizabeth Fry, and the noble
work she was doing among the prisoners at Newgate
made a deep impression on him. He determined
to do something to help the prisoners in Germany,
especially the poor women, who, after being
imprisoned for a certain time, were cast upon the
world with no possession save an ill name.</p>

<p>In his little garden stood an old summerhouse,
partly ruinous, but with strong walls. With his
own hands the good pastor mended the roof and
made the place clean and habitable. He put in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
bed, a table and a chair, and then prayed that God
would send to this shelter some poor soul who
needed it.</p>

<p>One night a homeless outcast woman came to the
door, and the pastor and his wife bade her welcome,
and took her to the clean pleasant room that was
all ready.</p>

<p>In this humble way opened the now famous institution
of Kaiserswerth. Other poor women soon
found out the friendly shelter; in a short time a new
and larger building was needed, and more helping
hands beside those of the good pastor and his devoted
wife. The good work grew and grew; some
of the poor women had children, and so a school
was started; the school must have good teachers,
and so a training school for teachers was opened.</p>

<p>But most of all Pastor Fliedner wished to help
the condition of the sick poor; three years after the
first opening of the summerhouse shelter in the garden
he founded the Deaconess Hospital. We are
told that it was opened "practically without patients
and without deaconesses." He obtained the use of
part of a deserted factory, and begged from his
neighbors old furniture and broken crockery, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
he mended carefully, and put in the big empty
rooms. He had only six sheets, but there was plenty
of water to wash them, and when the first patient,
a poor suffering servant maid, came to the door,
she was made comfortable in a spotless bed, in a
clean though bare room.</p>

<p>I wish I could tell you the whole beautiful story,
but it would take too long. By the end of the year
there were sixty patients in the hospital, and seven
deaconess nurses to care for them. To-day there
is a deaconess hospital or home in almost every
town in Germany, and thousands upon thousands
of sick and poor people bless the deaconesses,
though they may never have heard the name of
Pastor Fliedner.</p>

<span class="small">WAITING FOR THE CALL.</span></h2>


<p>Miss Nightingale spent two periods
of training at Kaiserswerth. When she
left it finally, good Pastor Fliedner laid
his hands on her head and gave her his
blessing in simple and earnest words; and she carried
with her the love and good wishes of all the
pious and benevolent community.</p>

<p>I wish we had a picture of her in her deaconess
costume. The blue cotton gown, white apron and
wide collar, and white muslin cap tied under the
chin with a large bow, must have set off her pensive
beauty very sweetly. She always kept a tender recollection
of Kaiserswerth, and says in a letter:
"Never have I met with a higher love and a purer
devotion than there."</p>

<p>On her way home, Miss Nightingale spent some
time with the Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul in
Paris. Here she saw what was probably the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
nursing in the world at that time; and she studied
the methods in her usual careful way, not only in
the hospitals, but in the homes of the poor and suffering,
where the good sisters came and went like
ministering angels. She had still another opportunity,
and this an unsought one, of learning what
they had to teach, for she fell ill herself, and was
tenderly cared for and restored to health by these
skillful and devoted women.</p>

<p>Returning to England, she spent some time in
the quiet of home, and as her strength returned, took
up her old work of visiting among the sick and poor
of the neighborhood. But this could not keep her
long. It was not that she did not love it, and did
not love her home dearly, but there were other
benevolent ladies who could do this work. She
realized this, and realized too, though perhaps unconsciously,
that she could do harder work than this,
and that there was plenty of hard work waiting to
be done. She soon found it. A call came asking
her to be superintendent of a Home for Sick Governesses
in London, and she accepted it at once.</p>

<p>Did you ever think how hard governesses have
to work? Did you ever think how tired they must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
often be, and how their heads must ache&mdash;and perhaps
their hearts, too&mdash;when they are trying to teach
you the lessons that you&mdash;perhaps again&mdash;are not
always willing to learn? Well, try to remember,
those of you who have your lessons in this way!
Remember that you can make the teaching a pain
or a pleasure, just as you choose; and that, after
all, the teacher is trying to help you, and to give
you knowledge that some day you would be very
sorry not to have.</p>

<p>In the days of which we are speaking, governesses
had a much harder time than nowadays, I think.
For one thing, there were not so many different
ways in which women could earn their bread. When
a girl had to make her own living she went out as
a governess almost as a matter of course, whether
she had any love for teaching or not, simply because
there was nothing else to do. So the teaching
was often mere drudgery, and often, too, was not
well done; and that meant discontent and unhappiness,
and very likely broken health to follow.</p>

<p>The Harley Street Home, as it was then called,
was founded to help poor gentlewomen who had lost
their health in this kind of life. When Miss Nightingale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
came to it, things were in a bad condition,
owing to lack of means and good management. The
friends of the institution were discouraged; but discouragement,
was a word not to be found in Miss
Nightingale's dictionary. There was no money?
Well, there must <i>be</i> money! She went quietly to
work, interested her own friends to subscribe, then
talked with the discouraged people, restoring their
confidence and inducing them to renew their subscriptions;
and soon, with no fuss or flourish of
trumpets, the money was in hand.</p>

<p>Then she proceeded, just as quietly, to reorganize
the whole institution; engaged competent nurses,
arranged the daily life of the inmates, planned and
wrote and worked, every day and all day, till she
had brought order out of chaos, and made the home,
instead of a place of disorder and discontent, one of
comfort, peace, and cheerfulness.</p>

<p>You must not think that this was light or pleasant
work. Sick and nervous and broken-down women
are not easy to deal with; a hospital (for this is
what the home really was) is not an easy thing to
organize and superintend. It meant, as I have said,
hard and vexatious work every day and all day; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
I dare say that often and often, when night came,
Florence Nightingale lay down to rest more weary
than any of her patients.</p>

<p>At length her health gave way under the strain;
she broke down, and was forced to give up the work
and go home to Embley for a long rest.</p>

<p>It was here, in her own home, amid her own
beautiful fields and gardens, that the call came which
summoned her to the great work of her life.</p>

<p>Open your atlas at the map of Russia.
Look down toward the bottom, at that
part of the great empire which borders
on the Euxine or Black Sea; there you
will find a small peninsula&mdash;it is really almost an
island, being surrounded on three sides by water&mdash;labeled
"<i>Crimea</i>." It is only a part of one of the
smallest of Russia's forty-odd provinces, the province
of Taurida; yet it is one of the famous places
of history, for here, in the years 1854 and 1855, was
fought the Crimean War, one of the greatest wars
of modern times.</p>

<p>Russia and Turkey have never been good neighbors.
They have always been jealous of each other,
always quarreling about this or that, the fact being
that each is afraid of the other's getting too much
land and too much power. In these disputes the
other countries of Europe have generally sympathized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
with Turkey, feeling that Russia had quite
enough power, and that if she had more it might be
dangerous for all of them. Some day you will read
in history about the Eastern Question and the Balance
of Power, and will find out just what these
meant in the Fifties; but this is all that you need
know now, in order to understand what I am going
to tell you.</p>

<p>In 1854 Turkey, feeling that Russia was pressing
too hard upon her, called upon the other European
powers to help her. The result was that England,
France, Sardinia (now a part of Italy, but then a
separate kingdom), and Turkey made an agreement
with one another, and all together declared war upon
Russia.</p>

<p>England had been at peace with all the world for
forty years, ever since the wars of Napoleon, which
were closed by the great victory of Waterloo. The
English are a brave race; they had forgotten the
horrors of war, and remembered only its glories
and its victories; and they sprang to arms as joyously
as boys run to a football game. "Sharpen
your cutlasses, and the day is ours!" said Sir
Charles Napier to his men, just before the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
fleet sailed; and this was the feeling all through the
country.</p>

<p>The fleets of the allied powers gathered in the
Black Sea, forming one great armada; surrounded
the peninsula of the Crimea, and landed their armies.
In September, 1854, was fought the first great battle,
by the Alma River. The allies were victorious, and
a great shout of joy went up all over England.
"Victory! victory!" cried old and young. There
were bells and bonfires and illuminations; the whole
country went mad with joy, and for a short time
no one thought of anything except glory, waving
banners and sounding trumpets. But banners and
trumpets, though a real part of war, are only a very
small part. After a little time, through the shouting
and rejoicing a different sound was heard; the
sound of weeping and lamentation, not only for
the hundreds of brave men who were lying dead
beside the fatal river, but for the other hundreds
of sick and wounded soldiers, dying for want of
care.</p>

<p>There had been gross neglect and terrible mismanagement
in the carrying on of the war. Nobody
knew just whose fault it was, but everything seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to be lacking that was most needed on that desolate
shore of the Crimea. The English troops were in
an enemy's country, and a poor country at that;
whatever supplies there were had been taken by the
Russian armies for their own needs. Food and
clothing had been sent out from England in
great quantities, but somehow, no one could find
them. Some supplies had been stowed in the hold
of vessels, and other things piled on top so that
they could not be got at; some were stored in
warehouses which no one had authority to open;
some were actually rotting at the wharves, for
want of precise orders as to their disposal. The
surgeons had no bandages, the doctors no medicines;
it was a state of things that to-day we can
hardly imagine. Indeed, it seemed as if the need
were so great and terrible that it paralyzed those
who saw it.</p>

<p>"It is now pouring rain," wrote William Howard
Russell to the London <i>Times</i>, "the skies are black
as ink, the wind is howling over the staggering
tents, the trenches are turned into dykes; in the
tents the water is sometimes a foot deep; our men
have not either warm or waterproof clothing; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
are out for twelve hours at a time in the trenches;
they are plunged into the inevitable miseries of a
winter campaign&mdash;and not a soul seems to care
for their comfort, or even for their lives. These
are hard truths, but the people of England must
hear them. They must know that the wretched beggar
who wanders about the streets of London in the
rain, leads the life of a prince compared with the
British soldiers who are fighting out here for their
country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The commonest accessories of a hospital are
wanting; there is not the least attention paid to decency
or clean linen; the stench is appalling; the
fetid air can hardly struggle out to taint the atmosphere,
save through the chinks in the walls and
roofs; and for all I can observe, these men die
without the least effort being made to save them.
There they lie, just as they were let gently down
on the ground by the poor fellows, their comrades,
who brought them on their backs from the
camp with the greatest tenderness, but who are
not allowed to remain with them. The sick appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
to be tended by the sick, and the dying by the
dying."</p>

<p>He added that the snow was three feet deep on a
level, and the cold so intense that many soldiers
were frozen in their tents.</p>

<p>No one meant to be cruel or neglectful; but there
were not half enough doctors, and&mdash;think of it,
children! there were <i>no nurses</i>.</p>

<p>How did this happen? Well, when the war broke
out the military authorities did not want female
nurses. The matter was talked over, and it was decided
that things would go better without them.
This was put on the ground that the class of nurses,
as I have told you, was at that time in England a
very poor one. They were often drunken, generally
unfeeling, and always ignorant. The War Department
decided that this kind of nurse would do more
harm than good; they did not realize that "The
old order changeth, yielding place to new," and that
the time was come when the new nurse must replace
the old.</p>

<p>But now the need was come, immediate and terrible,
and there was no one to meet it. When the
people of England realized this; when they learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
that the hospital at Scutari was filled with sick and
wounded and dying men, and no one to care for
them save a few male orderlies, wholly untrained
for the task; when they heard that in the hospitals
of the French army the Sisters of Mercy were doing
their blessed work, tending the wounded, healing
the sick and comforting the dying, and realized
that the English soldiers, their own sons, brothers
and husbands, had no such help and no such comfort,
the sound of bell and trumpet was lost in a
great cry of anger and sorrow that went up from
the whole country.</p>

<p>And matters grew worse and worse, as one great
battle after another sent its dreadful fruits to the
already overflowing hospital at Scutari. On October
25th came Balaklava; on November 5th, Inkerman.</p>

<p>You have all read "The Charge of the Light
Brigade"; yet I ask you to read it again here, so
that it may fit into its place in the story of this terrible
war. Remember, it is only one incident of
that great battle of Balaklava, in which both sides
claimed the victory, while neither gained any signal
advantage.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of William Howard Russell.
He was the war correspondent of the <i>Times</i>,
the great English newspaper, and a man of intelligence,
heart and feeling. He was on the spot,
and saw the horrors of the war at first-hand.
His heart was filled with sorrow and pity for the
suffering around him, and with indignation that
so little was done to relieve it; and he wrote day
after day home to England, telling what he saw
and what was needed. Soon after Balaklava he
wrote:</p>

<p>"Are there no devoted women amongst us, able
and willing to go forth to minister to the sick and
suffering soldiers of the East in the hospitals at
Scutari? Are there none of the daughters of England,
at this extreme hour of need, ready for such
a work of mercy? France has sent forth her Sisters
of Mercy unsparingly, and they are even now by
the bedsides of the wounded and the dying, giving
what woman's hand alone can give of comfort and
relief. Must we fall so far below the French in
self-sacrifice and devotedness, in a work which
Christ so signally blesses as done unto Himself?
'I was sick and ye visited me.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the trumpet call that rang in the ears
of the women of England, sounding a clearer note
than all the clarions of victory. We shall see how
it was answered.</p>

<span class="small">THE RESPONSE.</span></h2>


<p>Mr. Sidney Herbert (afterwards
Lord Herbert of Lea) was at this time
at the head of the War Department in
England. He was a man of noble nature
and tender heart, whose whole life was spent in
doing good, and in helping those who needed help.
He heard with deep distress the dreadful tidings of
suffering that came from the Crimea, and his heart
responded instantly to the call for help. Yes, the
women of England must rise up and go to that far,
desolate land to tend and nurse the sick and wounded
and dying; but who should lead them? What one
woman had the strength, the power, the wisdom,
the tenderness, to meet and overcome the terrible
conditions? Asking himself this question, Mr. Herbert
answered without a moment's hesitation: "Florence
Nightingale!"</p>

<p>He knew Miss Nightingale well; she was a dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
friend of himself and his beautiful wife, and had
again and again given them help and counsel in planning
and managing their many charities, hospitals,
homes for sick children, and so forth. He knew that
she possessed all the qualities needed for this work,
and he wrote to her, asking if she would undertake
it. Would she, he asked, go out to Scutari, taking
with her a band of nurses who would be under her
orders, and take charge of the hospital nursing?</p>

<p>He did not make light of the task.</p>

<p>"The selection of the rank and file of nurses
would be difficult&mdash;no one knows that better than
yourself. The difficulty of finding women equal to
a task after all full of horror, and requiring, besides
intelligence and goodwill, great knowledge and
great courage will be great; the task of ruling them
and introducing system among them great, and not
the least will be the difficulty of making the whole
work smoothly with the medical and military authorities
out there. This it is which makes it so
important that the experiment should be carried out
by one with administrative capacity and experience."</p>

<p>He went on to assure Miss Nightingale that she
should have full power and authority, and told her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
frankly that in his opinion she was the one woman
in England who was capable of performing this
great task.</p>

<p>"I must not conceal from you that upon your
decision will depend the ultimate success or failure
of the plan.... If this succeeds, an enormous
amount of good will be done now, and to persons
deserving everything at our hands; and which will
multiply the good to all time."</p>

<p>It was a noble letter, this of Mr. Herbert's, but
he might have spared himself the trouble of writing
it. Florence Nightingale, in her quiet country home,
had heard the call to the women of England; and
even while Mr. Herbert was composing his letter to
her, she was writing to him, a brief note, simply
offering her services in the hospitals at Scutari. Her
letter crossed his on the way; and the next day it
was proclaimed from the War Office that Miss
Nightingale, "a lady with greater practical experience
of hospital administration and treatment than
any other lady in the country," had been appointed
by Government to the office of Superintendent of
Nurses at Scutari, and had undertaken the work
of organizing and taking out nurses thither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Great was the amazement in England. Nothing
of this kind had ever been heard of before. "Who
is Miss Nightingale?" people cried all over the
country. They were answered by the newspapers.
First the <i>Examiner</i> and then the <i>Times</i> told them
that Miss Nightingale was "a young lady of singular
endowments both natural and acquired. In a
knowledge of the ancient languages and of the
higher branches of mathematics, in general art,
science, and literature, her attainments are extraordinary.
There is scarcely a modern language
which she does not understand, and she speaks
French, German and Italian as fluently as her native
English. She has visited and studied all the
various nations of Europe, and has ascended the
Nile to its remotest cataract. Young (about the
age of our Queen), graceful, feminine, rich, popular,
she holds a singularly gentle and persuasive influence
over all with whom she comes in contact.
Her friends and acquaintances are of all classes and
persuasions, but her happiest place is at home, in
the centre of a very large band of accomplished relatives,
and in simplest obedience to her admiring
parents."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>One who knew our heroine well wrote in a more
personal vein:</p>

<p>"Miss Nightingale is one of those whom God
forms for great ends. You cannot hear her say a
few sentences&mdash;no, not even look at her, without
feeling that she is an extraordinary being. Simple,
intellectual, sweet, full of love and benevolence, she
is a fascinating and perfect woman. She is tall and
pale. Her face is exceedingly lovely; but better
than all is the soul's glory that shines through every
feature so exultingly. Nothing can be sweeter than
her smile. It is like a sunny day in summer."</p>

<p>Though well known among a large circle of earnest
and high-minded persons, Miss Nightingale's
name was entirely new to the English people as a
whole, and&mdash;everything else apart&mdash;they were delighted
with its beauty. Had she been plain Mary
Smith, she would have done just as good work, but
it would have been far harder for her to start it.
Florence Nightingale was a name to conjure with,
as the saying is, and it echoed far and wide. Everybody
who could write verses (and many who could
not), began instantly to write about nightingales.
<i>Punch</i> printed a cartoon showing a hospital ward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
with the "ladybirds" hovering about the cots of
the sick men, each bird having a nurse's head. Another
picture represented one of the bird-nurses flying
through the air, carrying in her claws a jug
labeled "Fomentation, Embrocation, Gruel." This
was called "The Jug of the Nightingale," for many
people think that some of the bird's beautiful, liquid
notes sound like "jug, jug, jug!"</p>

<p>Not content with pictures, <i>Punch</i> printed "The
Nightingale's Song to the Sick Soldier," which became
very popular, and was constantly quoted in
those days.</p>

<p>Of course there were some people who shook
their heads; there always are when any new work
is undertaken. Some thought it was improper for
women to nurse in a military hospital; others
thought they would be useless, or worse; others
again thought that the nurses would ruin their own
health and be sent home in a month to the hospitals
of England. There were still other objections,
which were strongly felt in those days, however
strange they may sound in our ears to-day.</p>

<p>"Oh, dreadful!" said some people; "Miss Nightingale
is a Unitarian!"</p>

<p>"Oh, shocking!" said others. "Miss Nightingale
is a Roman Catholic!" And so it went on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
But while they were talking and exclaiming, drawing
pictures and singing songs, Miss Nightingale
was getting ready. In six days from the time she
undertook the work she was ready to start, with
thirty nurses, chosen with infinite care and pains
from the hundreds who had volunteered to go.
There was no flourish of trumpets. While England
was still wondering how they could go, and whether
they ought to be allowed to go&mdash;behold, they were
gone! slipping away by night, as if they were bound
on some secret errand. Indeed, Miss Nightingale
has never been able to endure "fuss and feathers,"
and all her life she has looked for a bushel large
enough to hide her light under, though happily she
has never succeeded.</p>

<p>Only a few relatives and near friends stood on the
railway platform on that evening of October 21,
1854. Miss Nightingale, simply dressed in black,
was very quiet, very serene, with a cheerful word
for everyone; no one who saw her parting look
and smile ever forgot them. So, in night and silence,
the "Angel Band" whose glory was soon
to shine over all the world, left the shores of
England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>But though England slept that night, France was
wide awake the next morning. The fishwives of
Boulogne had heard what was doing across the
Channel, and were on the lookout. When Miss
Nightingale and her nurses stepped ashore they were
met by a band of women, in snowy caps and rainbow-striped
petticoats, all with outstretched hands,
all crying, "Welcome, welcome, our English
sisters!"</p>

<p>They knew, Marie and Jeanne and Suzette. Their
own husbands, sons, and brothers were fighting and
dying in the Crimea; their own nurses, the blessed
Sisters of Mercy, had from the first been toiling in
hospital and trench in that dreadful land; how
should they not welcome the English sisters who
were going to join in the holy work?</p>

<p>Loudly they proclaimed that none but themselves,
the fishwives of Boulogne, should help the <i>s&oelig;urs
Anglaises</i>. They shouldered bag and baggage;
they swung the heavy trunks up on their broad
backs, and with laughter and tears mingled in true
French fashion, trudged away to the railway station.
Pay? Not a sou; not a centime! The blessing
of our English sisters is all we desire; and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
they should chance to see Pierre or Jacques <i>là-bas</i>&mdash;ah!
the heavens are over all. A handshake, then,
and <i>Adieu! Adieu! vivent les s&oelig;urs!</i> the good God
go with you!</p>

<p>And that prayer was surely answered.</p>

<span class="small">SCUTARI.</span></h2>


<p>Open the atlas once more at the map of
Russia, and look downward from the
Crimea, across the Black Sea toward the
southwest. You see a narrow strait
marked "Bosporus" leading from the Black Sea to
the Sea of Marmora; and on either side of the strait
a black dot, one marked "Constantinople," the other
"Scutari." It is to Scutari that we are going, but
we must not pass the other places without a word,
for they are very famous. This is the land of story,
and every foot of ground, every trickle of water,
has its legend or fairy tale, or true story of sorrow
or heroism.</p>

<p>Bosporus means "the cow's ford." It was
named, the old story says, for Io, a beautiful maiden
beloved of Zeus. To conceal her from the eyes of
Hera, his jealous wife, Zeus turned Io into a snow-white
heifer; but Hera, suspecting the truth, persuaded
him to give the poor pretty creature to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Then followed a sad time. Hera set Argus, a giant
with a hundred eyes, to watch the heifer, lest she
escape and regain her human form. The poor
heifer-maiden was so unhappy that Zeus sent
Hermes to set her free; and the cunning god told
stories to Argus till he fell asleep, and then cut off
his head, hundred eyes and all. Hera took the eyes
and put them in the tail of her sacred peacock, and
there they are to this day. Meantime Io ran away
as fast as she could, but she could not escape the
vengeance of the jealous goddess. Hera sent a gadfly
after her, which stung her cruelly, and pursued
her over land and sea. The poor creature fled wildly
hither and thither; swam across the Ionian Sea,
which has borne her name ever since; roamed over
the whole breadth of what is now Turkey, and finally
came to the narrow strait or ford between the
two seas. Here she crossed again, and went on her
weary way; and here again she left&mdash;not her own
name, but that of the animal in whose form she
suffered. Poor Io! one is glad to read that she was
released at last, and given her woman's body again.
True? No, the story is not true, but it is very
famous. Those of you who care about moths will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
find another reminder of Io in the beautiful <i>Saturnia
Io</i>, which is named for the Greek maiden and
her cruel foe, Saturnia being another name for Hera
or Juno.</p>

<p>The scenery along the banks of the Bosporus is
so beautiful that whole books have been written
about it. On either side are seven promontories and
seven bays; indeed, it is almost a chain of seven
lakes, connected by seven swift-rushing currents.
The promontories are crowned with villages, towns,
palaces, ruins, each with its own beauty, its own interest,
its own story; but we cannot stay for these;
we must go onward to where, at the lower end of
the passage, with its long, narrow harbor, the Golden
Horn, curling round it, lies Constantinople, the
wonder-city.</p>

<p>Here indeed we must stop for a moment, for this
is one of the most famous cities of history. In
ancient days, when Rome was in her glory and long
before, it was Byzantium that lay shining in the
curve of the Golden Horn; Byzantium the rich, the
powerful, the desired of all; fought over through
successive generations by Persian, Greek, Gaul and
Roman; conquered, liberated, conquered again. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the second century of our era it was besieged by
the Roman emperor Severus, and after a heroic resistance
lasting three years, was taken and laid waste
by the conqueror. But the city sprang up again,
more beautiful than ever, and a century and a half
later the emperor Constantine made it the capital of
the Roman Empire, and gave it his own name.</p>

<p>Constantinopolis, the City of Constantine; so it
became in the year 330, and so it remains to this
day, but not under the rule of Romans or their descendants.</p>

<p>"Blessed shall he be who shall take Constantinople!"
So, three hundred years later, exclaimed
Mohammed, the prophet and leader of men. His
disciples and followers never forgot the saying, and
many wars were fought, many desperate attempts
made by the Mohammedans to win the wonder
city. It was another Mohammed, not a prophet but
a great soldier, surnamed the Conqueror, who finally
conquered it, in 1453, after another tremendous
siege, of which you will read in history. There is
a terrible story about the entry of this savage conqueror
into the city. It is said that its inhabitants,
mostly Christians, though of various nationalities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
took refuge in the great church of St. Sophia,
and were there barbarously slaughtered by the ferocious
Turks. In the south aisle of the church the
dead lay piled in great heaps, and in over this dreadful
rampart rode Mohammed on his war horse; and
as he rode, he lifted his bloody right hand and smote
one of the pillars, and there&mdash;so the story says&mdash;the
mark may be seen to this day.</p>

<p>From that time to our own Constantinople has
been the capital city of the Turkish Empire. Again,
I wish I might tell you about at least a few of its
many wonders, for I have seen some of them, but
again I must hasten on.</p>

<p>The city is so great that it overflows in every
direction; in fact, there are three cities in one: Stamboul,
the central division, filling the tongue of land
between the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmora;
Galata, on the farther bank of the Horn; and Scutari,
on the opposite shore of the Bosporus. It
is to the last-named that we are going.</p>

<p>Although actually a suburb of Constantinople,
Scutari is a town in itself, and a large and ancient
one. In the earliest times of the great
Persian monarchy, it was called <i>Chrysopolis</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Golden City. Its present name means in Persian a
courier who carries royal orders from station to
station; that is because the place has always, from
its earliest days, been a <i>rendezvous</i> for caravans,
messengers, travelers of every description. Here
Xenophon and his Greeks, returning from the war
against Cyrus, halted for seven days while the soldiers
disposed of the booty they had won in the
campaign. Here, for hundreds of years, stood the
three colossal statues, forty-eight feet high, erected
by the Byzantians in honor of the Athenians, who
had saved them from destruction at the hands of
Philip the Lacedæmonian. Here, to-day, are
mosques and convents, palaces and tombs, especially
the last; for the burying ground of Scutari is one of
the largest in the world, and its silent avenues hold,
some say, twenty times as many dwellers as the gay
and noisy streets of Stamboul.</p>

<p>It is a strange place, this great burying ground.
Beside each tomb rises a cypress tree, tall and majestic.
The tombs themselves are mostly pillars of
marble, with a globe or ball on the top; and perched
atop of this globe is in many cases a turban or a fez,
carved in stone and painted in gay colors. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
shows that a man lies beneath; the women's tombs
are marked by a grapevine or a stem of lotus,
also carved in marble. At foot of the column is a
flat stone, hollowed out in the middle to form a
small basin. Some of these basins are filled with
flowers or perfumes; in others, the rain and dew
make a pleasant bathing and drinking place for the
birds who fly in great flocks about the quiet place.</p>

<p>Not far from this great cemetery is another place
of burial, that of the English; and this is laid out like
a lovely garden, and watched and tended with loving
care; for here rest the brave men who fell in this
terrible war of the Crimea, or who wasted away in
the great building that towers foursquare over all
the neighborhood. We must look well at this building,
the Barrack Hospital of Scutari, for this is
what Florence Nightingale came so far to see.
Through all the long, wearisome journey, I doubt
whether she gave much heed to the beauties or the
discomforts of the way. Her eyes were set steadfastly
forward, following her swift thoughts; and
eyes and thoughts sought this one thing, this gaunt,
bare building rising beside the new-made graves.
Let us follow her and see what she found there.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />

<span class="small">THE BARRACK HOSPITAL.</span></h2>


<p>The Barrack Hospital at Scutari was just
what its name implies. It was built for
soldiers to live in, and was big enough
to take in whole regiments. Surrounding
the four sides of a quadrangle, each one of its
sides was nearly a quarter of a mile long, and it
was believed that twelve thousand men could be
exercised in the great central court. Three sides of
the building were arranged in galleries and corridors,
rising story upon story; we are told that these
long narrow rooms, if placed end to end, would
cover four miles of ground. At each corner rose
a tower; the building was well situated, and looked
out over the Bosporus toward the glittering mosques
and minarets of Stamboul.</p>

<p>You would think that this vast building would
hold all the sick and wounded men of one short war;
but this was not so. Seven others were erected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and all were filled to overflowing; but the Barrack
Hospital was Miss Nightingale's headquarters, and
the chief scene of her labors, though she had authority
over all; I shall therefore describe the situation
and the work as she found it there.</p>

<p>If there had been mismanagement at home in
England, there had been even worse at the seat of
war. The battles, you remember, were all fought
in the Crimea. They were cruel, terrible battles,
too terrible to dwell upon here. Hundreds and
thousands were killed; but other hundreds and thousands
lay wounded and helpless on the field. In
those days there was no Red Cross, no field practice,
no first aid to the injured. The poor sufferers
were taken, all bleeding and fainting as they were,
to the water side, and there put in boats which carried
them, tossing on the rough waters of the Black
Sea, across to Scutari. Several days would pass before
any were got from the battlefield to the ferry
below the hospital, and most of them had not had
their wounds dressed or their broken limbs set.
Often they had had no food; they were tortured by
fever and thirst; and now they must walk, if they
could drag themselves, or be dragged or carried by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
others up the hill to the hospital. We can fancy
how they looked forward to rest; how they thought
of comfort, aid, relief from pain. Alas! they found
little of all these things.</p>

<p>The Barrack Hospital had been built by the Turks,
and lent to the English by the Turkish Government;
it had been meant for the hardy Turkish soldiery to
sleep in, and there were no appliances to fit it for a
hospital. We are told that in the early months of
the war "there were no vessels for water or utensils
of any kind; no soap, towels or cloths, no hospital
clothes; the men lying in their uniforms, stiff with
gore and covered with filth to a degree and of a
kind no one could write about; their persons covered
with vermin, which crawled about the floors
and walls of the dreadful den of dirt, pestilence and
death to which they were consigned."</p>

<p>Is this too dreadful to read about? But it was
not too dreadful to happen. The poor fellows, laid
down in the midst of all this horror, would wait
with a soldier's patience, hoping for the doctor or
surgeon who should bind up their wounds and relieve
their terrible suffering. Alas! often and often
death was more prompt than the doctor, and stilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the pain forever, before any human aid had been
given.</p>

<p>One of Miss Nightingale's assistants writes:</p>

<p>"How can I ever describe my first day in the hospital
at Scutari? Vessels were arriving and orderlies
carrying the poor fellows, who with their
wounds and frost-bites had been tossing about on
the Black Sea for two or three days and sometimes
more. Where were they to go? Not an available
bed. They were laid on the floor one after another,
till the beds were emptied of those dying of cholera
and every other disease. Many died immediately
after being brought in&mdash;their moans would pierce
the heart&mdash;and the look of agony on those poor
dying faces will never leave my heart. They may
well be called 'the martyrs of the Crimea.'"</p>

<p>Where were the doctors? They were there, doing
their very best; working day and night, giving
their strength and their lives freely; but there were
not half, not a tenth part, enough of them; and
there was no one to help them but the orderlies,
who, as I have said, had had no training, and knew
nothing of sickness or hospital work. The conditions
grew so frightful that a kind of paralysis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
seemed to fall upon the minds of the workers. They
felt that the task was hopeless, and they went
about their duties like people in a nightmare. The
strangest thing of all, to us now, seems to be that
they <i>did not tell</i>. Though Mr. Russell and others
wrote to England of the horrors of the hospitals,
the authorities themselves were silent, or if questioned,
would only reply that everything was "all
right." There was no inspection that was worthy
of the name. The same officers who would front
death on the battlefield with a song and a laugh,
shrank from meeting it in the hospital wards, the
air of which was heavy with the poison of cholera
and fever.</p>

<p>"An orderly officer took the rounds of the wards
every night, to see that all was in order. He was
of course expected by the orderlies, and the moment
he raised the latch he received the word: 'All
right, your honor!' and passed on. This was
hospital inspection!"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In fact, these orderlies too often, I fear, bore
some resemblance to the old class of nurses that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
I described, and were in many cases rough, unfeeling,
ignorant men. Sometimes it was for this
reason that they drank the brandy which should
have been given to their patients; but often, again,
it was because they were ill themselves, or else because
they were so overcome by the horrors around
them that they drank just to bring forgetfulness for
a time.</p>

<p>The strange paralysis of which I have spoken
seemed to hang over everything connected with the
unfortunate soldiers of the Crimea. Mr. Sidney
Herbert assured Miss Nightingale that the hospitals
were supplied with every necessary. He had reason
to think so, for the things had been sent, had
left England, had reached the shores of the Bosporus.
"Medical stores had been sent out by the
ton." But where were they? I have already told
you; they were rotting on the wharves, locked
up in the warehouses, buried in the holds of vessels;
they were everywhere except in the hospitals.
The doctors had nothing to work with, but
they could not leave their work to find out why
it was.</p>

<p>The other authorities said it was "all right!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
They knew the things had come, but they were not
sure just who were the proper persons to open the
cargoes, take out and distribute the stores; it must
not be done except by the proper persons. This
is what is called <i>red tape</i>; it stands for authority
without intelligence, and many books have been
written about it. I remember, when I was a child,
a cartoon in <i>Punch</i> showing the British soldier entangled
in the coils of a frightful serpent, struggling
for life; the serpent was labeled "<i>Red Tape</i>."
(The monster is still alive in our day, but he is
not nearly so powerful, and people are always on
the lookout for him, and can generally drive him
away.)</p>

<p>This was the state of things when Miss Nightingale
and her band of nurses arrived at Scutari.
Her first round of the hospitals was a terrible experience,
which no later one ever effaced from her
mind. The air of the wards was so polluted as to
be perfectly stifling. "The sheets," she said, "were
of canvas, and so coarse that the wounded men
begged to be left in their blankets. It was indeed impossible
to put men in such a state of emaciation into
those sheets. There was no bedroom furniture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
any kind, and only empty beer or wine bottles for
candlesticks."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The wards were full to overflowing, and the corridors
crowded with sick and wounded, lying on the
floor, with the rats running over them. She looked
out of the windows; under them were lying dead
animals in every state of decay, refuse and filth
of every description. She sought the kitchens; there
were no kitchens, and no cooks; at least nothing
that would be recognized to-day as a hospital
kitchen. In the barrack kitchen were thirteen huge
coppers; in these the men cooked their own food,
meat and vegetables together, the separate portions
inclosed in nets, all plunged in together, and taken
out when some one was ready to take them. Part
of the food would be raw when it came out, another
part boiled to rags. This was all the food
there was, for sick and well, the wounded, the fever-stricken,
the cholera patient. No doubt hundreds
died from improper feeding alone.</p>

<p>She looked for the laundry; there was no laundry.
There were washing contracts, but up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
time of her arrival "only seven shirts had been
washed." The clothes and bed linen of wounded
men and of those sick with infectious diseases were
thrown in together. Moreover, the contractors
stole most of the clothes that came into their hands,
so that the sick did not like to part with their few
poor garments, for fear of never seeing them
again, and were practically without clean linen,
except when a soldier's wife would now and then
take compassion on them, and wash out a few
articles.</p>

<p>These were the conditions that Florence Nightingale
had to meet. A delicate and sensitive
woman, reared amid beauty and luxury, these were
the scenes among which she was to live for nearly
two years. But one thing more must be noted. Do
you think everyone was glad to see her and her
nurses? Not by any means! The overwrought
doctors were dismayed and angered at the prospect
of a "parcel of women" coming&mdash;as they fancied&mdash;to
interfere with their work, and make it harder
than it was already. The red-tape officials were
even less pleased. What? A woman in petticoats, a
"Lady-in-Chief," coming to inquire into their deeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and their methods? Had they not said repeatedly
that everything was all right? What was the meaning
of this?</p>

<p>This was her coming; this is what she found;
now we shall see what she did.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />

<span class="small">THE LADY-IN-CHIEF.</span></h2>


<p>Miss Nightingale arrived at Scutari
on November 4th. You have
seen what she found; but there was
worse to come. Only twenty-four hours
after her arrival, the wounded from the battle of
Inkerman began to come in; soon every inch of
room in both the Barrack and the General hospital
was full, and men by hundreds were lying on the
muddy ground outside, unable to find room even on
the floor of the corridor. Neither Lady-in-Chief nor
nurses had had time to rest after their long voyage,
to make plans for systematic work, even to draw
breath after their first glimpse of the horrors around
them, when this great avalanche of suffering and
misery came down upon them. No woman in history
has had to face such a task as now flung itself
upon Florence Nightingale.</p>

<p>She met it as the great meet trial, quietly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
calmly. Her cheek might pale at what she had to
see, but there was no flinching in those clear, gray-blue
eyes, no trembling of those firm lips. Ship after
ship discharged its ghastly freight at the ferry below;
train after train of wounded was dragged
up the hill, brought into the overflowing hospital,
laid down on pallet, on mattress, on bare floor, on
muddy ground, wherever space could be found.
"The men lay in double rows down the long corridors,
forming several miles of suffering humanity."</p>

<p>As the poor fellows were brought in, they looked
up, and saw a slender woman in a black dress, with
a pale, beautiful face surmounted by a close-fitting
white cap. Quietly, but with an authority that no
one ever thought of disputing, she gave her orders,
directing where the sufferers were to be taken, what
doctor was to be summoned, what nurses to attend
them. During these days she was known sometimes
to stand on her feet <i>twenty hours at a time</i>, seeing
that each man was put in the right place, where he
might receive the right kind of help. I ask you
to think of this for a moment. Twenty hours!
nearly the whole of a day and night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Where a particularly severe operation was to be
performed, Miss Nightingale was present whenever
it was possible, giving to both surgeon and patient
the comfort and support of her wonderful calm
strength and sympathy. In this dreadful inrush of
the Inkerman wounded, the surgeons had first of
all to separate the more hopeful cases from those
that seemed desperate. The working force was so
insufficient, they must devote their energies to saving
those who could be saved; this is how it seemed
to them. Once Miss Nightingale saw five men lying
together in a corner, left just as they had come
from the vessel.</p>

<p>"Can nothing be done for them?" she asked the
surgeon in charge. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Then will you give them to me?"</p>

<p>"Take them," replied the surgeon, "if you like;
but we think their case is hopeless."</p>

<p>Do you remember the little girl sitting by the
wounded dog? All night long Florence Nightingale
sat beside those five men, one of the faithful
nurses with her, feeding them with a spoon at short
intervals till consciousness returned, and a little
strength began to creep back into their poor torn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
bodies; then washing their wounds, making them
tidy and decent, and all the time cheering them with
kind and hopeful words. When morning came the
surgeons, amazed, pronounced the men in good condition
to be operated upon, and&mdash;we will hope,
though the story does not tell the end&mdash;saved.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that one poor lad burst into
tears as he cried: "I can't help it, I can't indeed,
when I see them. Only think of Englishwomen
coming out here to nurse us! It seems so homelike
and comfortable."</p>

<p>In those days one of the nurses wrote home to
England:</p>

<p>"It does appear absolutely impossible to meet
the wants of those who are dying of dysentery and
exhaustion; out of four wards committed to my care,
eleven men have died in the night, simply from exhaustion,
which, humanly speaking, might have
been stopped, could I have laid my hand at once on
such nourishment as I knew they ought to have
had.</p>

<p>"It is necessary to be as near the scene of war
as we are, to know the horrors which we have seen
and heard of. I know not which sight is most heartrending&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
witness fine strong men and youths
worn down by exhaustion and sinking under it, or
others coming in fearfully wounded.</p>

<p>"The whole of yesterday was spent, first in sewing
the men's mattresses together, and then in washing
them, and assisting the surgeons, when we could,
in dressing their ghastly wounds, and seeing the
poor fellows made as easy as their circumstances
would admit of, after their five days' confinement
on board ship, during which space their wounds
were not dressed.... We have not seen a drop of
milk, and the bread is extremely sour. The butter
is most filthy&mdash;it is Irish butter in a state of decomposition;
and the meat is more like moist leather
than food. Potatoes we are waiting for until they
arrive from France."</p>

<p>This was written six days after arrival. By the
tenth day, a miracle had been accomplished. Miss
Nightingale had established and fitted up a kitchen,
from which eight hundred men were fed daily with
delicacies and food suitable to their condition. Beef-tea,
chicken broth, jelly&mdash;a quiet wave of the wand,
and these things sprang up, as it were, out of the
earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Hear how one of the men describes it himself.
On arriving at the hospital early in the morning,
he was given a bowl of gruel. "'Tommy, me boy,'
he said to himself, 'that's all you'll get into your
inside this blessed day, and think yourself lucky
you've got that.' But two hours later, if another
of them blessed angels didn't come entreating of
me to have just a little chicken broth! Well, I took
that, thinking maybe it was early dinner, and before
I had well done wondering what would happen
next, round the nurse came again with a bit o'
jelly, and all day long at intervals they kept on
bringing me what they called 'a little nourishment.'
In the evening, Miss Nightingale she came
and had a look at me, and says she, 'I hope you're
feeling better.' I could have said, 'Ma'am, I feels
as fit as a fightin' cock,' but I managed to git out
somethin' a bit more polite."</p>

<p>How was the miracle accomplished? Up to this
time, the method of giving out stores had been much
like the method (only there was really no method
about it!) of cooking and washing. There were
no regular hours; if you asked for a thing in the
morning, you might get it in the evening, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
barrack fires were out. And you could get nothing
at all until it had been inspected by this official,
approved by that, and finally given out by the other.
These were called "service rules"; they were really
folds and coils of the monster Red Tape, at
his work of binding and strangling. How was
the miracle accomplished? Simply enough. Miss
Nightingale, with the foresight of a born leader,
had anticipated all this, and was ready for it. The
materials for all the arrowroot, beef-tea, chicken
broth, wine jelly, of those first weeks, came out of
her own stores, brought out with her in the vessel,
the <i>Victis</i>, from England. She had no intention
of waiting a day or an hour for anyone; she had
not a day or an hour to waste.</p>

<p>It must have been a wonderful cargo, that of the
<i>Victis</i>; I can think of nothing but the astonishing
bag of the Mother in the "Swiss Family Robinson,"
or that still more marvelous one of the Fairy Blackstick.
Do you remember?</p>

<p>"And Giglio returned to his room, where the
first thing he saw was the fairy bag lying on the
table, which seemed to give a little hop as he came
in. 'I hope it has some breakfast in it,' says Giglio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
'for I have only a very little money left.' But
on opening the bag, what do you think was there?
A blacking-brush and a pot of Warren's jet, and on
the pot was written,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Poor young men their boots must black;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Use me and cork me and put me back!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So Giglio laughed and blacked his boots, and put
the brush and the bottle into the bag.</p>

<p>"When he had done dressing himself, the bag
gave another hop, and he went to it and took out&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. A tablecloth and napkin.</p>

<p>2. A sugar basin full of the best loaf sugar.</p>

<p>4, 6, 8, 10. Two forks, two teaspoons, two knives, and a
pair of sugar-tongs, and a butterknife, all marked G.</p>

<p>11, 12, 13. A teacup, saucer, and slop-basin.</p>

<p>14. A jug full of delicious cream.</p>

<p>15. A canister with black tea and green.</p>

<p>16. A large tea-urn and boiling water.</p>

<p>17. A saucepan, containing three eggs nicely done.</p>

<p>18. A quarter of a pound of best Epping butter.</p>

<p>19. A brown loaf.</p></div>

<p>"And if he hadn't enough now for a good breakfast,
I should like to know who ever had one?"</p>

<p>When I was your age, I never tired of reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
about this breakfast; and then there was that other
wonderful day when the bag was "grown so long
that the Prince could not help remarking it. He
went to it, opened it, and what do you think he
found in it?</p>

<p>"A splendid long gold-handled, red-velvet-scabbarded
cut-and-thrust sword, and on the sheath was
embroidered 'ROSALBA FOREVER!'"</p>

<p>But I am not writing the "Rose and the Ring"; I
wish I were!</p>

<p>So, as I said, all good and comforting things
came in those first days out of the Fairy Florence's
bag&mdash;I mean ship. She hired a house close by the
hospital, and set up a laundry, with every proper
and sanitary arrangement, and there, every week,
five hundred shirts were washed, besides other garments.
But now came a new difficulty. Many of
the soldiers had no clothes at all save the filthy and
ragged ones on their backs; what was to become
of them while their shirts were washed and mended?
The ship bag gave another hop (at least I should
think it would have, for pure joy of the good it
was doing), and out came ten thousand shirts;
and for the first time since they left the battlefield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the sick and wounded men were clean and comfortable.</p>

<p>But the Lady-in-Chief knew that her fairy stores
were not of the kind that renew themselves; and
having once got matters into something like decent
order and comfort in the hospital, she turned quietly
and resolutely to do battle with the monster Red
Tape.</p>

<p>The officials of Scutari did not know what to
make of the new state of things. As I have said,
many of them had shaken their heads and pulled
very long faces when they heard that a woman was
coming out who was to have full power and authority
over all things pertaining to the care of
the sick and wounded. They honestly thought, no
doubt, that the confusion would be doubled, the distraction
turned to downright madness. What could
a woman know about such matters? What experience
had she had of "service rules"? What would
become of them all?</p>

<p>They were soon to find out. The Lady-in-Chief
did not cry out, or wring her hands, or do any of
the things they had expected. Neither did she
bluster or rage, scold or reproach. She simply said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
that this or that must be done, and then saw
that it was done. Her tact and judgment were
as great as her power and wisdom; more I cannot
say.</p>

<p>Suppose she wanted certain stores that were in
a warehouse on the wharf. The warehouse was
locked. She sent for the wharfinger. Would he
please open the warehouse and give her the stores?
He was very sorry, but he could not do so without
an order from the board. She went to the chief
officer of the board. He was very sorry, but it
would be necessary to have a meeting of the entire
board. Who made up the board? Well, Mr. So-and-so,
and Dr. This, and Mr. That, and Colonel
'Tother. Where were they? Well, one of them
was not very well, and another was probably out
riding, and a third&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Would he please call them together at once?</p>

<p>Well, he was extremely busy just now, but to-morrow
or the day after, he would be delighted&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Would he be ready himself for a meeting, if Miss
Nightingale could get the other members of the
board together? Well&mdash;of course&mdash;he would be
delighted, but he could assure Miss Nightingale that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
everything would be all right, without her having
the trouble to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The board met; pen, ink and paper were ready.
Would they kindly sign the order? Many thanks!
Good morning!</p>

<p>And the warehouse was opened, and the goods
on their way to the hospital, before the astonished
gentlemen had fairly drawn their breath.</p>

<p>"But what kind of way is this to do business?"
cried the slaves of Red Tape. "She doesn't give
us time! The moment a thing is wanted, she goes
and gets it!!! The rules of the service&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But this was not true; for, as methodical as she
was wise and generous, Miss Nightingale was most
careful to consult the proper authorities, and, whenever
it was possible, to make them take the necessary
steps themselves. Once, and only once, did
she absolutely take the law into her own hands.
There came a moment when certain stores were
desperately needed for some sick and wounded men.
The stores were at hand, but they had not been
inspected, and Red Tape had decreed that nothing
should be given out until it had been inspected by
the board. (This was another board, probably;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
their name was Legion.) Miss Nightingale tried to
get the board together, but this time without success.
One was away, and another was ill, and a
third was&mdash;I don't know where. The clear gray-blue
eyes grew stern.</p>

<p>"I must have these things!" she said quietly.
"My men are dying for lack of them."</p>

<p>The under-official stammered and turned pale; he
did not wish to disobey her, but&mdash;it meant a court-martial
for him if he disobeyed the rules of the
service.</p>

<p>"You shall have no blame," said the Lady-in-Chief.
"I take the entire responsibility upon myself.
Open the door!"</p>

<p>The door was opened, and in a few moments the
sick men had the stimulants for lack of which they
were sinking into exhaustion.</p>

<p>When Miss Nightingale arrived at Scutari, the
death rate in the Barrack Hospital was sixty per
cent; within a few months it was reduced to one
per cent; and this, under heaven, was accomplished
by her and her devoted band of nurses. Do you
wonder that she was called "The Angel of the
Crimea?"</p>

<p>Miss Nightingale's headquarters
were in the "Sisters' Tower," as it came
to be called, one of the four corner towers
of the great building. Here was a
large, airy room, with doors opening off it on each
side. In the middle was a large table, covered with
stores of every kind, constantly in demand, constantly
replaced; and on the floor, and flowing into
all the corners, were&mdash;more stores! Bales of shirts,
piles of socks, slippers, dressing gowns, sheets, flannels&mdash;everything
you can think of that is useful and
comfortable in time of sickness. About these piles
the white-capped nurses came and went, like bees
about a hive; all was quietly busy, cheerful, methodical.
In a small room opening off the large one
the Lady-in-Chief held her councils with nurses,
doctors, generals or orderlies; giving to all the same
courteous attention, the same clear, calm, helpful
advice or directions. Here, too, for hours at a time,
she sat at her desk, writing; letters to Sidney Herbert
and his wife; letters to Lord Raglan, the commander-in-chief,
who, though at first averse to her
coming, became one of her firmest friends and admirers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
letters to sorrowing wives and mothers and
sisters in England. She received letters by the
thousand; she could not answer them all with her
own hand, but I am sure she answered as many as
was possible. One letter was forwarded to her by
the Herberts which gave a great pleasure not to
her only, but to everyone in all that place of suffering.
It was dated Windsor Castle, December
6, 1854.</p>

<p>"Would you tell Mrs. Herbert," wrote good
Queen Victoria, "that I beg she would let me see
frequently the accounts she receives from Miss
Nightingale or Mrs. Bracebridge, as <i>I hear no details
of the wounded</i>, though I see so many from officers,
etc., about the battlefield, and naturally the former
must interest me more than anyone.</p>

<p>"Let Mrs. Herbert also know that I wish Miss
Nightingale and the ladies would tell these poor,
noble wounded and sick men, that <i>no one</i> takes a
warmer interest or feels <i>more</i> for their sufferings or
admires their courage and heroism <i>more</i> than their
Queen. Day and night she thinks of her beloved
troops. So does the Prince.</p>

<p>"Beg Mrs. Herbert to communicate these my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
words to those ladies, as I know that <i>our</i> sympathy
is much valued by these noble fellows.&mdash;Victoria."</p>

<p>I think the tears may have come into those clear
eyes of Miss Nightingale, when she read these
words. She gave the letter to one of the chaplains,
and he went from ward to ward, reading it aloud
to the men, and ending each reading with "God
save the Queen!" The words were murmured or
whispered after him by the lips of sick and dying,
and through all the mournful place went a great
wave of tender love and loyalty toward the good
Queen in England, and toward their own queen,
their angel, who had shared her pleasure with
them.</p>

<p>You will hardly believe that in England, while the
Queen was writing thus, some people were still sadly
troubled about Miss Nightingale's religious views,
and were writing to the papers, warning other people
against her; but so it was. One clergyman
actually warned his flock not to subscribe money for
the soldiers in the East "if it was to pass through
Popish hands." He thought the Lady-in-Chief was
a Catholic; others still maintained that she was a
Unitarian; others were sure she had gone out with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the real purpose of converting the soldiers to High-Church
views.</p>

<p>In reading about this kind of thing, it is comforting
to find one good Irish clergyman who, being
asked to what sect Miss Nightingale belonged,
replied: "She belongs to a sect which unfortunately
is a very rare one&mdash;the sect of the Good Samaritans."</p>

<p>But these grumblers were only a few, we must
think. The great body of English people was filled
with an enthusiasm of gratitude toward the "angel
band" and its leader. From the Queen in her palace
down to the humblest working women in her
cottage, all were at work making lint and bandages,
shirts and socks and havelocks for the soldiers. Nor
were they content with making things. Every
housekeeper ransacked her linen closet and camphor
chest, piled sheets and blankets and pillowcases together,
tied them up in bundles, addressed them to
Miss Nightingale, and sent them off.</p>

<p>When Sister Mary Aloysius first began to sort
the bales of goods on the wharf at Scutari, she
thought that "the English nobility must have
emptied their wardrobes and linen stores, to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
out bandages for the wounded. There was the most
beautiful underclothing, and the finest cambric
sheets, with merely a scissors run here and there
through them, to insure their being used for no
other purpose, some from the Queen's palace, with
the royal monogram beautifully worked."</p>

<p>Yes, and the rats had a wonderful time with all
these fine and delicate things, before the Sisters
could get their hands on them!</p>

<p>These private gifts were not the only nor the
largest ones. The <i>Times</i>, which you will remember
had been the first to reveal the terrible conditions
in the Crimea, now set to work and organized a
fund for the relief of the wounded. A subscription
list was opened, and from every part of the
United Kingdom money flowed in like water. The
<i>Times</i> undertook to distribute the money, and appointed
a good and wise man, Mr. McDonald, to
go out to the East and see how it could best be
applied.</p>

<p>And now a strange thing came to pass; the sort
of thing that, in one way or another, was constantly
happening in connection with the Crimean War.
Mr. McDonald went to the highest authorities in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the War Office and told of his purpose. They bowed
and smiled and said the <i>Times</i> and its subscribers
were very kind, but the fact was that such ample
provision had been made by the Government that
it was hardly likely the money would be needed.
Mr. McDonald opened his eyes wide; but he was
a wise man, as I have said; so he bowed and smiled
in return, and going to Sidney Herbert, told his
story to him.</p>

<p>"Go!" said Mr. Herbert; "Go out to the
Crimea!" and he went.</p>

<p>When he reached the seat of war, it was the same
thing over again. The high officials were very polite,
very glad to see him, very pleased that the
people of England were so sympathetic and patriotic;
but the fact was that nothing was wanted; they
were amply supplied; in short, everything was "all
right."</p>

<p>Many men, after this second rebuff, would have
given the matter up and gone home; but Mr. McDonald
was not of that kind. While he was considering
what step to take next, one man came forward
to help him; one man who was brave enough
to defy Red Tape, for the sake of his soldiers. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
was the surgeon of the 39th regiment. I wish I
knew his name, so that you and I could remember
it. He came to Mr. McDonald and told him that
his regiment, which had been stationed at Gibraltar,
had been ordered to the Crimea and had now
reached the Bosporus. They were going on to
the Crimea, to pass the winter in bitter cold, amid
ice and snow; and they had no clothes save the
light linen suits which had been given them to wear
under the hot sun of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Here was a chance for the <i>Times</i> fund! Without
more ado Mr. McDonald went into the bazaars
of Constantinople and bought flannels and woolens,
until every man in that regiment had a good
warm winter suit in which to face the Crimean
winter.</p>

<p>Did anyone else follow the example of the surgeon
of the 39th? Not one! Probably many persons
thought he had done a shocking thing, by
thus exposing the lack of provision in the army
for its soldiers' comfort. This was casting reflection
upon Red Tape! Better for the soldier to freeze
and die, than for a slur to be cast upon those in authority,
upon the rules of the service!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>So, though McDonald stood with hands held out,
as it were, offering help, no one came forward to
take it.</p>

<p>He went to Scutari, and here at first it was the
same thing. He offered his aid to the chief medical
authority over the hospitals; the reply was calm
and precise: "Nothing was wanted!" He went
still higher, to "another and more august quarter";
the answer was still more emphatic: there was
no possible occasion for help; soldiers and sailors
had everything they required; if he wished to dispose
of the <i>Times</i> fund, it might be a good thing
to build an English church at Pera!</p>

<p>"Yet, at that very time," says the historian of
the Crimea, "wants so dire as to include want of
hospital furniture and of shirts for the patients, and
of the commonest means for maintaining cleanliness,
were afflicting our stricken soldiery in the
hospitals."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Mr. McDonald did not build an English church;
instead, he went to the Barrack Hospital and asked
for the Lady-in-Chief.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>
<p>I should like to have seen Florence Nightingale's
face when she heard his story. No help needed?
The soldiers supplied with everything they needed?
Everything "all right"?</p>

<p>"Come with me!" she said.</p>

<p>She took him through the wards of the Barrack
Hospital, and showed him what had been done, and
what an immense deal was yet to do; how, though
many were comfortably clad, yet fresh hundreds
were arriving constantly, half naked, without a
shred of clean or decent clothing on their backs;
how far the demand was beyond the supply; how
fast her own stores were dwindling, and how many
of the private offerings were unsuitable for the needs
they were sent to fill; how many men were still,
after all her labors, lying on the floor because there
were not beds enough to go round.</p>

<p>All these things good Mr. McDonald saw, and
laid to heart; but he saw other things besides.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of you have visited a hospital.
You have seen the bright, fresh, pleasant rooms,
the rows of snowy cots, the bright faces of the
nurses, here and there flowers and pictures; seeing
two or three hundred patients, it has seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
to you as if you had seen all the sick people in the
world. Was it not so?</p>

<p>In the Barrack Hospital (and this, remember,
was but one of eight, and these eight the English
hospitals alone!) there were two or three
thousand patients; it was a City of Pain. Its streets
were long, narrow rooms or corridors, bare and
gloomy; no furniture save the endless rows of cots
and mattresses, "packed like sardines," as one eye-witness
says; its citizens, men in every stage of
sickness and suffering; some tossing in fever and
delirium; some moaning in pain that even a soldier's
strength could not bear silently; some ghastly
with terrible wounds; some sinking into their final
sleep.</p>

<p>Following the light, slight figure of his guide
through these narrow streets of the City of Pain,
McDonald saw and noted that</p>

<p>"Wherever there is disease in its most dangerous
form, and the hand of the Spoiler distressingly
nigh, there is this incomparable woman sure to be
seen. Her benignant presence is an influence for
good comfort even among the struggles of expiring
nature. She is a 'ministering angel' without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
any exaggeration in these hospitals, and as the
slender form glides quietly along each corridor,
every poor fellow's face softens with gratitude at
the sight of her. When all the medical officers have
retired for the night, and silence and darkness have
settled down upon those miles of prostrate sick, she
may be observed alone, with lamp in her hand, making
her solitary rounds.</p>

<p>"The popular instinct was not mistaken which,
when she set out from England, hailed her as a
heroine; I trust she may not earn her title to a
higher though sadder appellation. No one who has
observed her fragile figure and delicate health can
avoid misgivings lest these should fail.... I
confidently assert that but for Miss Nightingale the
people of England would scarcely, with all their
solicitude, have been spared the additional pang of
knowing, which they must have done sooner or
later, that their soldiers, even in the hospitals, had
found scanty refuge and relief from the unparalleled
miseries with which this war has hitherto been
attended."</p>

<p>Look with me for a moment into one of these
wards, these "miles of sick" through which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
agent of the <i>Times</i> passed with his guide. It is
night. Outside, the world is wide and wonderful
with moon and stars. Beyond the dark-blue waters
of the Bosporus, the lights of Stamboul flash and
twinkle; nearer at hand, the moonlight falls on the
white city of the dead, and shows its dark cypresses
standing like silent guardians beside the marble
tombs; nearer yet, it falls full on the bare, gaunt
square of building that crowns the hill. The windows
are narrow, but still the moonbeams struggle
in, and cast a dim light along the corridor. The
vaulted roof is lost in blackness; black, too, are the
corners, and we cannot see where the orderly nods
in his chair, or where the night nurse sits beside
a dying patient. All is silent, save for a low moan
or murmur from one cot or another. See where
the moonbeam glimmers white on that cot under the
window! That is where the Highland soldier is
lying, he who came so near losing his arm the other
day. The surgeons said it must be amputated, but
the Lady-in-Chief begged for a little time. She
thought that with care and nursing the arm might
be saved; would they kindly delay the operation at
least for a few days? The surgeons consented, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
by this time no one could or would refuse her anything.
The arm <i>was</i> saved; now the bones are knitting
nicely, and by and by he will be well and strong
again, with both arms to work and play and fight
with.</p>

<p>But broken bones hurt even when they are knitting
nicely, and the Highland lad cannot sleep; he
lies tossing about on his narrow cot, gritting his
teeth now and then as the pain bites, but still a
happy and a thankful man. He stares about him
through the gloom, trying to see who is awake and
who asleep. But now he starts, for silently the
door opens, and a tiny ray of light, like a golden
finger, falls across his bed. A figure enters and
closes the door softly; the figure of a woman, tall
and slender, dressed in black, with white cap and
apron. In her hand she carries a small shaded lamp.
At sight of her the sick lad's eyes grow bright; he
raises his sound arm and straightens the blanket,
then waits in eager patience. Slowly the Lady with
the Lamp draws near, stopping beside each cot, listening
to the breathing and noting the color of the
sleepers, whispering a word of cheer and encouragement
to those who wake. Now she stands beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
his bed, and her radiant smile is brighter, he thinks,
than lamplight or moonlight. A few words in the
low, musical voice, a pat to the bedclothes, a friendly
nod, and she passes on to the next cot. As she
goes, her shadow, hardly more noiseless than her
footstep, falls across the sick man's pillow; he
turns and kisses it, and then falls happily asleep.</p>

<p>So she comes and passes, like a light; and so her
very shadow is blessed, and shall be blessed so long
as memory endures.</p>

<p>"The bad weather commenced about November
the 10th, and has continued
ever since. A winter campaign is under
no circumstances child's play; but
here, where the troops had no cantonments to
take shelter in, where large bodies were collected
in one spot, and where the want of sufficient fuel
soon made itself felt, it told with the greatest severity
upon the health, not of the British alone,
but of the French and Turkish troops.... To
the severity of the winter the whole army can
bear ample testimony. The troops have felt it in
all its intensity; and when it is considered that they
have been under canvas from ten to twelve months&mdash;that
they had no other shelter from the sun in
summer, and no other protection from wet and snow,
cold and tempestuous winds, such as have scarcely
been known even in this climate, in winter&mdash;and that
they passed from a life of total inactivity, already
assailed by deadly disease, to one of the greatest
possible exertion&mdash;it cannot be a matter of surprise
that a fearful sickness has prevailed throughout
their ranks, and that the men still suffer from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
it."&mdash;Lord Raglan to Lord Panmure, February,
1855.</p>

<p>After the battle of Inkerman, the allied armies
turned all their energies to the siege of Sebastopol,
the principal city of the Crimea. You will read
some day about this memorable siege, one of the
most famous in history, and about the prodigies of
valor performed by both besiegers and besieged; but
I can only touch briefly on those aspects of it which
are connected with my subject.</p>

<p>The winter of 1854-5 was, as Lord Raglan says,
one of unexampled severity, even in that land of
bitter winters. On November 14th a terrible hurricane
swept the country, bringing death and ruin to
Russians and allies alike. In Sebastopol itself
trees were torn up by the roots, buildings unroofed,
and much damage done; in the camps of the besiegers
things were even worse. Tents were torn in
shreds and swept away like dead leaves; not only
the soldiers' tents, but the great hospital marquees
were destroyed, and the sick and wounded left exposed
to bitter blast and freezing sleet. The
trenches were flooded; no fires could be lit, and
therefore no food cooked; and when the snowstorm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
came which followed the tempest, many a brave
fellow lay down famished and exhausted, and the
white blanket covered his last sleep.</p>

<p>In the harbor even more ruin was wrought, for
the ships were dashed about like broken toys that a
wilful child flings hither and thither. The <i>Prince</i>,
which had just arrived loaded with clothing, medicines,
stores of every description, went down with
all her precious freight; the <i>Resolute</i> was lost,
too, the principal ammunition ship of the army; and
other vessels loaded with hay for the horses, a supply
which would have fed them for twenty days.</p>

<p>This dreadful calamity was followed by day after
day of what the soldiers called "Inkerman weather,"
with heavy mists and low drizzling clouds; then
came bitter, killing frost, then snow, thaw, sleet,
frost again, and so round and round in a cruel circle;
and through every variation of weather the soldier's
bed was the earth, now deep in snow, now bare and
hard as iron, now thick with nauseous mud. All
day long the soldiers toiled in the trenches with
pick and spade, often under fire, always on the alert;
others on night duty, "five nights out of six, a
large proportion of them constantly under fire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Is it to be wondered at that plague and cholera
broke out in the camp of the besiegers, and that a
steady stream of poor wretches came creeping up
the hill at Scutari?</p>

<p>The Lady-in-Chief was ready for them. Thanks
to the <i>Times</i> fund and other subscriptions, she now
had ample provision for many days. Moreover, by
this winter time her influence so dominated the hospital
that not only was there no opposition to her
wishes, but everyone flew to carry them out. The
rough orderlies, who had growled and sworn at the
notion of a woman coming to order them about,
were now her slaves. Her unvarying courtesy, her
sweet and heavenly kindness, woke in many a rugged
breast feelings of which it had never dreamed; and
every man who worked for her was for the time
at least a knight and a gentleman. It was bitter,
hard work; she spared them no more than she spared
herself; but they labored as no rules of the service
had ever made them work. Through it all, not one of
them, orderlies or common soldiers, ever failed her
"in obedience, thoughtful attention, and considerate
delicacy." "Never," she herself says, "came from
any of them one word or one look which a gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
would not have used; and while paying this
humble tribute to humble courtesy, the tears come
into my eyes as I think how amidst scenes of loathsome
disease and death there arose above it all the
innate dignity, gentleness and chivalry of the men
(for never surely was chivalry so strikingly exemplified),
shining in the midst of what must be considered
as the lowest sinks of human misery, and
preventing instinctively the use of one expression
which could distress a gentlewoman."</p>

<p>If it was so with the orderlies, you can imagine
how it was with the poor fellows for whom she was
working. Every smile from her was a gift; every
word was a precious treasure to be stored away and
kept through life. They would do anything she
asked, for they knew she would do anything in her
power for them. When any specially painful operation
was to be performed (there was not always
chloroform enough, alas! and in any case it was
not given so freely in those days as it is now), the
Lady-in-Chief would come quietly into the operating
room and take her stand beside the patient; and
looking up into that calm, steadfast face, and meeting
the tender gaze of those pitying eyes that never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
flinched from any sight of pain or horror, he would
take courage and nerve himself to bear the pain,
since she was there to help him bear it.</p>

<p>"We call her the Angel of the Crimea," one
soldier wrote home. "Could bad men be bad in
the presence of an angel? Impossible!"</p>

<p>Another wrote: "Before she came there was
such cussin' and swearin' as you never heard; but
after she came it was as holy as a church."</p>

<p>And still another&mdash;perhaps our Highland lad of
the night vigil, perhaps another&mdash;wrote to his
people: "She would speak to one and another, and
nod and smile to many more; but she could not
do it to all, you know, for we lay there by hundreds;
but we could kiss her shadow as it fell, and lay our
heads on our pillows again content."</p>

<p>Miss Nightingale never wearied of bearing testimony
to the many virtues of the British soldier.
She loved to tell stories like the following:</p>

<p>"I remember a sergeant who, on picket&mdash;the rest
of the picket killed, and himself battered about the
head&mdash;stumbled back to camp (before Sebastopol),
and on his way, picked up a wounded man and
brought him on his shoulders to the lines, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
fell down insensible. When, after many hours, he
recovered his senses, I believe after trepanning, his
first words were to ask after his comrade: 'Is he
alive?'</p>

<p>"'Comrade indeed! yes, he's alive&mdash;it's the General!'
At that moment the General, though badly
wounded, appeared at the bedside. 'Oh! General,
it was you, was it, I brought in? I'm so glad; I
didn't know your honor. But if I'd known it was
you, I'd have saved you all the same!'"</p>

<p>I must not leave the story of this winter without
telling of all that Miss Nightingale did for the
soldiers' wives. There were many of these poor
women, who had come out to this far country to
be near their husbands. There was no proper provision
for them, and Miss Nightingale found them
in a wretched condition, living in three or four
damp, dark rooms in the basement of the hospital.
Their clothes were worn out; they were barefooted
and bareheaded. We are told that "the
only privacy to be obtained was by hanging up
rags of clothes on lines. There, by the light of a
rushlight, the meals were taken, the sick attended,
and there the babies were born and nourished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
There were twenty-two babies born from November
to December, and many more during the winter."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The Lady-in-Chief soon put an end to this state
of things. First she fed and clothed the women
from her own stores, and saw that the little babies
were made warm and comfortable. In January a
fever broke out among the women, owing to a
broken drain in the basement, and she found a
house near by, had it cleaned and furnished, and persuaded
the commandant to move the women into it.
All through the winter she helped these poor souls
in every way, employing some in the laundry, finding
situations for others in Constantinople, sending
widows home to England, helping to start a school
for the children. Altogether about five hundred
women were helped out of the miserable condition
in which she found them, and were enabled to earn
their own living honestly and respectably. Writing
of these times later, Miss Nightingale says: "When
the improvements in our system which the war must
suggest are discussed, let not the wife and child of
the soldier be forgotten."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>Another helper came out to Scutari in those
winter days; a gallant Frenchman, M. Soyer, who
had been for years <i>chef</i> of one of the great London
clubs, and who knew all that there was to know
about cookery. He read the <i>Times</i>, and in February,
1855, he wrote to the editor:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: After carefully perusing the letter of your
correspondent, dated Scutari ... I perceive that,
though the kitchen under the superintendence of
Miss Nightingale affords so much relief, the system
of management at the large one in the Barrack
Hospital is far from being perfect. I propose offering
my services gratuitously, and proceeding direct
to Scutari at my own personal expense, to regulate
that important department, if the Government will
honor me with their confidence, and grant me the
full power of acting according to my knowledge
and experience in such matters."</p>

<p>It was April before M. Soyer reached Scutari.
He went at once to the Barrack Hospital, asked for
Miss Nightingale, and was received by her in her
office, which he calls "a sanctuary of benevolence."
They became friends at once, for each could help
the other and greatly desired to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must especially express my gratitude to Miss
Nightingale," says the good gentleman in his record
of the time, "who from her extraordinary intelligence
and the good organization of her kitchen procured
me every material for making a commencement,
and thus saved me at least one week's sheer
loss of time, as my model kitchen did not arrive
until Saturday last."</p>

<p>M. Soyer, on his side, brought all kinds of things
which Miss Nightingale rejoiced to see: new stoves,
new kinds of fuel, new appliances of many kinds
which, in the first months of her work, she could
never have hoped to see. He was full of energy,
of ingenuity, and a fine French gayety and enthusiasm
which must have been delightful to all the
brave and weary workers in the City of Pain. He
went everywhere, saw and examined everything;
and told of what he saw, in his own flowery, fiery
way. He told among other things how, coming
back one night from a gay evening in the doctors'
quarters, he was making his way through the hospital
wards to his own room, when, as he turned
the corner of a corridor, he came upon a scene which
made him stop and hold his breath. At the foot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
one cot stood a nurse, holding a lighted lamp. Its
light fell on the sick man, who lay propped on
pillows, gasping for breath, and evidently near his
end. He was speaking, in hoarse and broken murmurs;
sitting beside him, bending near to catch the
painful utterances, was the Lady-in-Chief, pencil and
paper in hand, writing down the words as he spoke
them. Now the dying man fumbled beneath his
pillow, brought out a watch and some other small
objects, and laid them in her hand; then with a sigh
of relief, sank back content. It was two o'clock.
Miss Nightingale had been on her feet, very likely,
the whole day, perhaps had not even closed her eyes
in sleep; but word was brought to her that this man
was given up by the doctors, and had only a few
hours to live; and in a moment she was by his side,
to speak some final words of comfort, and to take
down his parting message to wife and children.</p>

<p>The kind-hearted Frenchman never forgot this
sight, yet it was one that might be seen any night in
the Barrack Hospital. No man should die alone and
uncomforted if Florence Nightingale and her women
could help it.</p>

<p>This is how M. Soyer describes our heroine:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is rather high in stature, fair in complexion
and slim in person; her hair is brown, and is worn
quite plain; her physiognomy is most pleasing; her
eyes, of a bluish tint, speak volumes, and are always
sparkling with intelligence; her mouth is small and
well formed, while her lips act in unison, and make
known the impression of her heart&mdash;one seems the
reflex of the other. Her visage, as regards expression,
is very remarkable, and one can almost anticipate
by her countenance what she is about to say;
alternately, with matters of the most grave import,
a gentle smile passes radiantly over her countenance,
thus proving her evenness of temper; at other times,
when wit or a pleasantry prevails, the heroine is lost
in the happy, good-natured smile which pervades her
face, and you recognize only the charming woman.</p>

<p>"Her dress is generally of a grayish or black tint;
she wears a simple white cap, and often a rough
apron. In a word, her whole appearance is religiously
simple and unsophisticated. In conversation
no member of the fair sex can be more amiable and
gentle than Miss Nightingale. Removed from her
arduous and cavalierlike duties, which require the
nerve of a Hercules&mdash;and she possesses it when required&mdash;she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
is Rachel<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> on the stage in both tragedy
and comedy."</p>

<p>The long and dreary winter was over. The snow
was gone, and the birds sang once more among the
cypresses of Scutari, and sunned themselves, and
bathed and splashed in the marble basins at the foot
of the tombs; but there was no abatement of the
stream that crept up the hill to the hospital. No
frostbite now&mdash;I haven't told you about that, because
it is too dreadful for me to tell or for you to
hear&mdash;but no less sickness. Cholera was raging in
the camp before Sebastopol, and typhus, and dysentery;
the men were dying like flies. The dreaded
typhus crept into the hospital and attacked the workers.
Eight of the doctors were stricken down, seven
of whom died. "For a time there was only one
medical attendant in a fit state of health to wait
on the sick in the Barrack Hospital, and his services
were needed in twenty-four wards."</p>

<p>Next three of the devoted nurses were taken, two
dying of fever, the third of cholera. More and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>more severe grew the strain of work and anxiety for
Miss Nightingale, and those who watched her with
loving anxiety trembled. So fragile, so worn; such
a tremendous weight of care and responsibility on
those delicate shoulders! Is she not paler than
usual to-day? What would become of us if she&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Their fears were groundless; the time was not
yet. Tending the dying physicians as she had tended
their patients; walking, sad but steadfast, behind
the bier that bore her dear and devoted helpers
to the grave; adding each new burden to the rest,
and carrying all with unbroken calm, unwearying
patience; Florence Nightingale seemed to bear a
charmed life. There is no record of any single instance,
through that terrible winter and spring, of
her being unable to perform the duties she had
taken upon her. She might have said with Sir Galahad:</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />

<span class="small">MISS NIGHTINGALE UNDER FIRE.</span></h2>


<p>In May, 1855, Miss Nightingale decided
to go to the Crimea, to inspect the hospitals
there. In the six months spent at
Scutari, she had brought its hospitals
into excellent condition; now she felt that she must
see what was being done and what still needed to
be done elsewhere. Accordingly she set sail in the
ship <i>Robert Lowe</i>, accompanied by her faithful
friend Mr. Bracebridge, who, with his admirable
wife, had come out with her from England, and had
been her constant helper and adviser; M. Soyer, who
was going to see how kitchen matters were going
<i>là-bas</i>, and her devoted boy Thomas. Thomas had
been a drummer boy. He was twelve years old,
and devoted to his drum until he came under the
spell of the Lady-in-Chief. Then he transferred his
devotion to her, and became her aide-de-camp, following
her wherever she went, and ready at any moment
to give his life for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>It was fair spring weather now, and the fresh,
soft air and beautiful scenery must have been specially
delightful to the women who had spent six
months within the four bare walls of the hospital
surrounded by misery and death; but when she
found that there were some sick soldiers on board,
Miss Nightingale begged to be taken to them. She
went from one to another in her cheerful way, and
every man felt better at once. Presently she came
to a fever patient who was looking very discontented.</p>

<p>"This man will not take his medicine!" said the
attendant.</p>

<p>"Why will you not take it?" asked Miss Nightingale,
with her winning smile.</p>

<p>"Because I took some once," said the man, "and
it made me sick, and I haven't liked physic ever
since."</p>

<p>"But if I give it to you myself you will take it,
won't you?"</p>

<p>I wonder if anyone ever refused Miss Nightingale
anything!</p>

<p>"It will make me sick just the same, ma'am!"
murmured the poor soul piteously; but he took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
medicine, and forgot to be sick as she sat beside him
and asked about the battle in which he had been
wounded.</p>

<p>When they entered the harbor of Balaklava, they
found all the vessels crowded with people. Word
had got abroad that the Lady-in-Chief was expected,
and everybody was agog to see the wonderful
woman who had done such a great work in the
hospitals of Scutari. The vessel was no sooner
brought to anchor than all the doctors and officials
of Balaklava came on board, eager to pay their respects
and welcome her to their shore. For an hour
she received these various guests, but she could not
wait longer, and by the time Lord Raglan, the Commander-in-Chief,
reached the vessel on the same errand,
she had already begun her inspection of the
hospital on shore. She never had any time to waste,
and so she never lost any.</p>

<p>But the visit of a Commander-in-Chief must be
returned; so the next day Miss Nightingale set out
on horseback, with a party of friends, for the camp
of the besiegers. M. Soyer, who was of the party,
tells us that she "was attired simply in a genteel
amazone, or riding-habit, and had quite a martial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
air. She was mounted upon a very pretty mare,
of a golden color, which, by its gambols and caracoling,
seemed proud to carry its noble charge. The
weather was very fine. Our cavalcade produced an
extraordinary effect upon the motley crowd of all
nations assembled at Balaklava, who were astonished
at seeing a lady so well escorted."</p>

<p>The road was very bad, and crowded with people
of every nationality, riding horses, mules and asses,
driving oxen and cows and sheep. Now they passed
a cannon, stuck in the mud, its escort prancing and
yelling around it; now a wagon overturned, its contents
scattered on the road, its owner sitting on the
ground lamenting. Everywhere horses were kicking
and whinnying, men shouting and screaming.
It is no wonder that Miss Nightingale's pretty mare
"of a golden color" got excited too, and kicked
and pranced with the rest; but her rider had not
scampered over English downs and jumped English
fences for nothing, and the pretty creature soon
found that she, like everyone else, must obey the
Lady-in-Chief.</p>

<p>The first hospital they came to was in the village
of Kadikoi. After inspecting it, and seeing what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
was needed, Miss Nightingale and her party rode
to the top of a hill near by; and here for the first
time she looked down on the actual face of war;
saw the white tents of the besiegers and in the distance
the grim walls of the beleaguered city; saw,
too, the puffs of white smoke from trench and bastion,
heard the roar of cannon and the crackle of
musketry. To the boy beside her no doubt it was
a splendid and inspiring sight; but Florence Nightingale
knew too well what it all meant, and turned
away with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>Lord Raglan, not having been warned of her
coming, was away; so, after visiting several small
regimental hospitals, Miss Nightingale went on to
the General Hospital before Sebastopol. Here she
found some hundreds of sick and wounded. Word
passed along the rows of cots that the "good lady
of Scutari" was coming to visit them, and everywhere
she was greeted with beaming smiles and
murmurs of greeting and welcome. But when she
came out again, and passed along toward the cooking
encampment, she was recognized by some former
patients of hers at the Barrack Hospital, and a
great shout of rejoicing went up; a shout so loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
that the golden mare capered again, and again had
to learn who her mistress was.</p>

<p>Now they approached the walls of Sebastopol;
and Miss Nightingale, who did not know what fear
was, insisted upon having a nearer view of the city.
They came to a point from which it could be conveniently
seen; but here a sentry met them, and
with a face of alarm begged them to dismount.
"Sharp firing going on here," he said, and he pointed
to the fragments of shell lying about; "you'll
be sure to attract attention, and they'll fire at
you."</p>

<p>Miss Nightingale laughed at his fears, but consented
to take shelter behind a stone redoubt, from
which, with the aid of a telescope, she had a good
view of the city.</p>

<p>But this was not enough. She must go into
the trenches themselves. The sentry was horrified.
"Madam," said he, "if anything happens I call
upon these gentlemen to witness that I did not fail
to warn you of the danger."</p>

<p>"My good young man," replied Miss Nightingale,
"more dead and wounded have passed
through my hands than I hope you will ever see in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the battlefield during the whole of your military
career; believe me, I have no fear of death."</p>

<p>They went on, and soon reached the Three-Mortar
Battery, situated among the trenches and very
near the walls. And here M. Soyer had a great
idea, which he carried out to his immense satisfaction.
You shall hear about it in his own words:</p>

<p>"Before leaving the battery, I begged Miss
Nightingale as a favor to give me her hand, which
she did. I then requested her to ascend the stone
rampart next the wooden gun carriage, and lastly
to sit upon the centre mortar, to which requests she
very gracefully and kindly acceded. 'Gentlemen,'
I cried, 'behold this amiable lady sitting fearlessly
upon that terrible instrument of war! Behold the
heroic daughter of England&mdash;the soldier's friend!'
All present shouted 'Bravo! hurrah! hurrah! Long
live the daughter of England!'"</p>

<p>When Lord Raglan heard of this, he said that
the "instrument of war" on which she sat ought
to be called "the Nightingale mortar."</p>

<p>The 39th regiment was stationed close by; and
seeing a lady&mdash;a strange enough sight in that place&mdash;seated
on a mortar, gazing calmly about her, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
if all her life had been spent in the trenches, the
soldiers looked closer, and all at once recognized
the beloved Lady-in-Chief, the Angel of the Crimea.
They set up a shout that went ringing over the fields
and trenches, and startled the Russians behind the
walls of Sebastopol; and Miss Nightingale, startled
too, but greatly touched and moved, came down
from her mortar and mounted her horse to ride back
to Balaklava.</p>

<p>It was a rough and fatiguing ride, and the next
day she felt very tired; but she was used to being
tired, and never thought much of it, so she set out
to visit the General Hospital again. After spending
several hours there, she went on to the Sanatorium,
a collection of huts high up on a mountainside,
nearly eight hundred feet above the sea. The sun
was intensely hot, the ride a hard one; yet she not
only reached it this day, but went up again the day
after, to install three much-needed nurses there; this
done, she went on with her work in the hospitals of
Balaklava. But, alas! this time she had gone beyond
even her strength. She was stricken down
suddenly, in the midst of her work, with the worst
form of Crimean fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctors ordered that she should be taken to
the Sanatorium. Amid general grief and consternation
she was laid on a stretcher, and the soldiers for
whom she had so often risked her life bore her sadly
through the streets of Balaklava and up the mountainside.
A nurse went with her, a friend held a
white umbrella between her and the pitiless sun,
and poor little Thomas, "Miss Nightingale's man"
as he had proudly called himself, followed the
stretcher, crying bitterly. Indeed, it seemed as if
everyone were crying. The rough soldiers&mdash;only
she never found them rough&mdash;wept like children.
It was a sad little procession that wound its way up
the height, to the hut that had been set apart for the
beloved sufferer. It was a neat, airy cabin, set on
the banks of a clear stream. All about were spring
buds and blossoms, and green, whispering trees; it
was just such a place as she would have chosen for
one of her own patients; and here, for several days,
she lay between life and death.</p>

<p>The news spread everywhere; Florence Nightingale
was ill&mdash;was dying! All Balaklava knew it;
soon the tidings came to Scutari, to her own hospital,
and the sick men turned their faces to the wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
and wept, and longed to give their own lives for
hers, if only that might be. The news came to England,
and men looked and spoke&mdash;ay, and felt&mdash;as
if some great national calamity threatened. But
soon the messages changed their tone. The disease
was checked; she was better; she was actually recovering,
and would soon be well. Then all the
Crimea rejoiced, and at Scutari they felt that spring
had come indeed.</p>

<p>While she still lay desperately ill, a visitor climbed
the rugged height to the Sanatorium, and knocked
at the door of the little lonely hut. I think you must
hear about this visit from Mrs. Roberts, the nurse
who told M. Soyer about it:</p>

<p>"It was about five o'clock in the afternoon when
he came. Miss Nightingale was dozing, after a
very restless night. We had a storm that day, and
it was very wet. I was in my room sewing when
two men on horseback, wrapped in large guttapercha
cloaks and dripping wet, knocked at the door. I
went out, and one inquired in which hut Miss Nightingale
resided.</p>

<p>"He spoke so loud that I said: 'Hist! hist! don't
make such a horrible noise as that, my man,' at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
same time making a sign with both hands for
him to be quiet. He then repeated his question,
but not in so loud a tone. I told him this was the
hut.</p>

<p>"'All right,' said he, jumping from his horse;
and he was walking straight in when I pushed him
back, asking what he meant and whom he wanted.</p>

<p>"'Miss Nightingale,' said he.</p>

<p>"'And pray who are you?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, only a soldier,' was the reply, 'but I must
see her&mdash;I have come a long way&mdash;my name is
Raglan&mdash;she knows me very well.'</p>

<p>"Miss Nightingale overhearing him, called me
in, saying: 'Oh! Mrs. Roberts, it is Lord Raglan.
Pray tell him I have a very bad fever, and it will
be dangerous for him to come near me.'</p>

<p>"'I have no fear of fever or anything else,' said
Lord Raglan.</p>

<p>"And before I had time to turn round, in came
his lordship. He took up a stool, sat down at the
foot of the bed, and kindly asked Miss Nightingale
how she was, expressing his sorrow at her illness,
and praising her for the good she had done for the
troops. He wished her a speedy recovery, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
hoped she might be able to continue her charitable
and invaluable exertions, so highly appreciated by
everyone, as well as by himself. He then bade Miss
Nightingale goodbye, and went away...."</p>

<p>After twelve days Miss Nightingale was pronounced
convalescent. The doctors now earnestly
begged her to return to England, telling her that
her health absolutely required a long rest, with entire
freedom from care. But she shook her head
resolutely. Her work was not yet over; she would
not desert her post. Weak as she was, she insisted
on being taken back to Scutari; she would come
back by and by, she said, and finish the work in the
Crimea itself. Sick or well, there was no resisting
the Lady-in-Chief. The stretcher was brought again,
and eight soldiers carried her down the mountainside
and so down to the port of Balaklava. The
<i>Jura</i> lay at the wharf; a tackle was rigged, and the
stretcher hoisted on board, the patient lying motionless
but undaunted the while; but this vessel
proved unsuitable, and she had to be moved twice
before she was finally established on a private yacht,
the <i>New London</i>.</p>

<p>Before she sailed, Lord Raglan came to see her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
again. It was the last time they ever met, for a
few weeks after the brave commander died, worn
out by the struggles and privations of the war, and&mdash;some
thought&mdash;broken-hearted by the disastrous
repulse of the British troops at the Redan.</p>

<p>Rather more than a month after she had left for
the Crimea, Miss Nightingale saw once more the
towers and minarets of Constantinople flashing
across the Black-Sea water, and, on the other side
of the narrow Bosporus, the gaunt white walls
which had come to seem almost homelike to her.
She was glad to get back to her Scutari and her
people. She knew she should get well here, and so
she did.</p>

<p>The welcome she received was most touching.
All the great people, commanders and high authorities,
met her at the pier, and offered her their
houses, their carriages, everything they had, to help
her back to strength; but far dearer to her than this
were the glances of weary eyes that brightened at
her coming, the waving of feeble hands, the cheers
of feeble voices, from the invalid soldiers who, like
herself, were creeping back from death to life, and
who felt, very likely, that their chance of full recovery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
was a far better one now that their angel
had come back to dwell among them.</p>

<p>As strength returned, Miss Nightingale loved to
walk in the great burying ground of which I have
told you; to rest under the cypress trees, and watch
the little birds, and pick wild flowers in that lovely,
lonely place. There are strange stories about the
birds of Scutari, by the way; the Turks believe
that they are the souls of sinners, forced to flit and
hover forever, without rest; but it is not likely that
thoughts of this kind troubled Miss Nightingale, as
she watched the pretty creatures taking their bath,
or pecking at the crumbs she scattered.</p>

<p>Birds and flowers, green trees and soft, sweet air&mdash;all
these things ministered to her, and helped her
on the upward road to health and strength; and before
long she was able to take up again the work
which she loved, and which was waiting for her
hand.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br />

<span class="small">THE CLOSE OF THE WAR.</span></h2>


<p>The sun soared over the gulf, where the
water, covered with ships at anchor, and
with sail- and row-boats in motion,
played merrily in its warm and luminous
rays. A light breeze, which scarcely shook the
leaves of the stunted oak bushes that grew beside
the signal station, filled the sails of the boats, and
made the waves ripple softly. On the other side of
the gulf Sebastopol was visible, unchanged, with its
unfinished church, its column, its quay, the boulevard
which cut the hill with a green band, the elegant
library building, its little lakes of azure blue,
with their forests of masts, its picturesque aqueducts,
and, above all that, clouds of a bluish tint, formed
by powder smoke, lighted up from time to time by
the red flame of the firing. It was the same proud
and beautiful Sebastopol, with its festal air, surrounded
on one side by the yellow smoke-crowned
hills, on the other by the sea, deep blue in color and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
sparkling brilliantly in the sun. At the horizon,
where the smoke of a steamer traced a black line,
white, narrow clouds were rising, precursors of a
wind. Along the whole line of the fortifications,
along the heights, especially on the left side, spurted
out suddenly, torn by a visible flash, although it was
broad daylight, plumes of thick white smoke, which,
assuming various forms, extended, rose, and colored
the sky with sombre tints. These jets of smoke
came out on all sides&mdash;from the hills, from the hostile
batteries, from the city&mdash;and flew toward the
sky. The noise of the explosions shook the air with
a continuous roar. Toward noon these smoke puffs
became rarer and rarer, and the vibrations of the air
strata became less frequent.</p>

<p>"'Do you know that the second bastion is no
longer replying?' said the hussar officer on horseback,
'it is entirely demolished. It is terrible!'</p>

<p>"'Yes, and the Malakoff replies twice out of three
times,' answered the one who was looking through
the field-glass. 'This silence is driving me mad!
They are firing straight on the Korniloff battery and
that is not replying.'</p>

<p>"'There is a movement in the trenches; they are
marching in close columns.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, I see it well,' said one of the sailors; 'they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
are advancing by columns. We must set the signal.'</p>

<p>"'But see, there&mdash;see! They are coming out of
the trenches!'</p>

<p>"They could see, in fact, with the naked eye black
spots going down from the hill into the ravine, and
proceeding from the French batteries toward our
bastions. In the foreground, in front of the former,
black spots could be seen very near our lines. Suddenly,
from different points of the bastion at the
same time, spurted out the white plumes of the discharges,
and, thanks to the wind, the noise of a
lively fusillade could be heard, like the patter of a
heavy rain against the windows. The black lines
advanced, wrapped in a curtain of smoke, and came
nearer. The fusillade increased in violence. The
smoke burst out at shorter and shorter intervals,
extended rapidly along the line in a single light, lilac-colored
cloud, unrolling and enlarging itself by
turns, furrowed here and there by flashes or rent by
black points. All the noises mingled together in the
tumult of one continued roar.</p>

<p>"'It is an assault,' said the officer, pale with emotion,
handing his glass to the sailor.</p>

<p>"Cossacks and officers on horseback went along
the road, preceding the commander-in-chief in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
carriage, accompanied by his suite. Their faces expressed
the painful emotion of expectation.</p>

<p>"'It is impossible that it is taken!' said the officer
on horseback.</p>

<p>"'God in heaven&mdash;the flag! Look now!' cried
the other, choked by emotion, turning away from
the glass. 'The French flag is in the Malakoff
mamelon!'"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is thus that Tolstoi, the great Russian writer,
describes the fall of Sebastopol, as he saw it. At
the same moment that the French were taking the
Malakoff redoubt, the British were storming the
Redan, from which they had been so disastrously repulsed
three months before. The flags of the allied
armies floated over both forts, and in the night that
followed the Russians marched silently out of the
fallen city, leaving flames and desolation behind
them.</p>

<p>The war was over. The good news sped to England,
and the great guns of the Tower of London
thundered out "Victory!"</p>

<p>"Victory!" answered every arsenal the country
over. "Victory!" rang the bells in every village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
steeple. "Victory!" cried man, woman, and child
throughout the length and breadth of the land. But
mingled with the shouts of rejoicing was a deeper
note, one of thankfulness that the cruel war was
done, and peace come at last.</p>

<p>In these happy days Miss Nightingale's name was
on all lips. What did not England owe to her, the
heroic woman who had offered her life, and had all
but lost it, for the soldiers of her country? What
should England do to show her gratitude? People
were on fire to do something, make some return
to Florence Nightingale for her devoted services.
From the Queen to the cottager, all were asking:
"What shall we do for her?"</p>

<p>It was decided to consult her friends, the Sidney
Herberts, as to the shape that a testimonial of the
country's love and gratitude should take in order
to be acceptable to Miss Nightingale. Mrs. Herbert,
being asked, replied: "There is but one testimonial
which would be accepted by Miss Nightingale.
The one wish of her heart has long been to
found a hospital in London and to work it on her
own system of unpaid nursing, and I have suggested
to all who have asked my advice in this matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
to pay any sums that they may feel disposed to give,
or that they may be able to collect, into Messrs.
Coutts' Bank, where a subscription list for the purpose
is about to be opened, to be called the 'Nightingale
Hospital Fund,' the sum subscribed to be
presented to her on her return home, which will enable
her to carry out her object regarding the reform
of the nursing system in England."</p>

<p>Here was something definite indeed. A committee
was instantly formed&mdash;a wonderful committee,
with "three dukes, nine other noblemen, the Lord
Mayor, two judges, five right honorables, foremost
naval and military officers, physicians, lawyers, London
aldermen, dignitaries of the Church, dignitaries
of nonconformist churches, twenty members of Parliament,
and several eminent men of letters"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>; and
the subscription was opened. How the money came
pouring in! You would think no one had ever spent
money before. The rich gave their thousands, the
poor their pennies. There were fairs and concerts
and entertainments of every description, to swell the
Nightingale fund; but the offering that must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
touched Miss Nightingale's heart most deeply was
that of the soldiers and sailors of England. "The
officers and men of nearly every regiment and many
of the vessels contributed a day's pay."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> That
meant more to her, I warrant, than any rich man's
thousands.</p>

<p>Before a year had passed, the fund amounted to
over forty thousand pounds; and there is no knowing
how much higher it might have gone had not
Miss Nightingale herself come home and stopped it.</p>

<p>That was enough, she said; if they wanted to give
more money, they might give it to the sufferers
from the floods in France.</p>

<p>But she did not come home at once; no indeed!
The war might be over, but her work was not, and
she would never leave it while anything remained
undone. The war was over, but the hospitals, especially
those of the Crimea itself, were still filled
with sick and wounded soldiers, and until the formal
peace was signed an "army of occupation" must
still remain in the Crimea. Miss Nightingale knew
well that idleness is the worst possible thing for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>soldiers (as for everyone); and while she cared for
the sick and wounded, she took as much pains to
provide employment and amusement for the rest.
As soon as she had fully regained her strength, she
returned to the Crimea as she had promised to do,
set up two new camp hospitals, and established a
staff of nurses, taking the charge of the whole nursing
department upon herself. These new hospitals
were on the heights above Balaklava, not far from
where she had passed the days of her own desperate
illness. She established herself in a hut close by the
hospitals and the Sanatorium, and here she spent a
second winter of hard work and exposure. It was
bitter cold up there on the mountainside. The hut
was not weather-proof, and they sometimes found
their beds covered with snow in the morning; but
they did not mind trifles like this.</p>

<p>"The sisters are all quite well and cheerful,"
writes Miss Nightingale; "thank God for it! They
have made their hut look quite tidy, and put up with
the cold and inconveniences with the utmost self-abnegation.
Everything, even the ink, freezes in
our hut every night."</p>

<p>In all weathers she rode or drove over the rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
and perilous roads, often at great risk of life and
limb. Her carriage being upset one day, and she
and her attendant nurse injured, a friend had a
carriage made on purpose for her, to be at once
secure and comfortable.</p>

<p>It was "composed of wood battens framed on the
outside and basketwork. In the interior it is lined
with a sort of waterproof canvas. It has a fixed
head on the hind part and a canopy running the full
length, with curtains at the side to inclose the interior.
The front driving seat removes, and thus
the whole forms a sort of small tilted wagon with
a welted frame, suspended on the back part on which
to recline, and well padded round the sides. It is
fitted with patent breaks to the hind wheels so as
to let it go gently down the steep hills of the Turkish
roads."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>This curious carriage is still preserved at Lea
Hurst. Miss Nightingale left it behind her when
she returned to England, and it was about to be
sold, with other abandoned articles, when our good
friend M. Soyer heard of it; he instantly bought it,
sent it to England, and afterwards had the pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
of restoring it to its owner. She must have
been amused, I think, but no doubt she was pleased,
too, at the kindly thought.</p>

<p>But this comfortable carriage only increased her
labors, in one way, for with it she went about more
than ever. No weather was too severe, no snowstorm
too furious, to keep her indoors; the men
needed her and she must go to them. "She was
known to stand for hours at the top of a bleak
rocky mountain near the hospitals, giving her instructions
while the snow was falling heavily. Then
in the bleak dark night she would return down the
perilous mountain road with no escort save the
driver."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>It was not only for the invalids that Miss Nightingale
toiled through this second winter; much of
her time was given to the convalescents and those
who were on active duty. She established libraries,
and little "reading huts," where the men could
come and find the English magazines and papers,
and a stock of cheerful, entertaining books, carefully
chosen by the dear lady who knew so well what
they liked. She got up lectures, too, and classes for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
those who wished to study this or that branch of
learning; and she helped to establish a café at Inkerman,
where the men could get hot coffee and
chocolate and the like in the bitter winter weather.
There really seems no end to the good and kind and
lovely things she did. I must not forget one thing,
which may seem small to some of you, but which
was truly great in the amount of good that came
from it. Ever since she first came out to Scutari,
she had used all her influence to persuade the soldiers
to write home regularly to their families. The
sick lads in the hospital learned that if they would
write a letter&mdash;just two or three lines, to tell mother
or sister that they were alive and doing well&mdash;and
would send it to the Lady-in-Chief, she would put
a stamp on it and speed it on its way. So now, in
all the little libraries and reading huts, there were
pens, ink and paper, envelopes and stamps; and
when Miss Nightingale looked in at one of these
cheerful little gathering places, we may be sure that
she asked Jim or Joe whether he had written to his
mother this week, and bade him be sure not to
forget it. Does this seem to you a small thing?
Wait till you go away from home, and see what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the letters that come from home mean to you; then
multiply that by ten, and you will know partly, but
not entirely, what your letters mean to those at home.
It has always seemed to me that this was a very
bright star in Miss Nightingale's crown of glory.</p>

<p>The soldier's wife and child, mother and sister,
were always in her thoughts. Not only did she
persuade the men to write home, but she used all
her great influence to induce them to send home
their pay to their families. At Scutari she had a
money-order office of her own, and four afternoons
in each month she devoted to receiving money from
the soldiers who brought it to her, and forwarding
it to England. It is estimated that about a thousand
pounds was sent each month, in small sums of
twenty or thirty shillings. "This money," says
Miss Nightingale, "was literally so much rescued
from the canteen and drunkenness."</p>

<p>After the fall of Sebastopol the British Government
followed her example, and set up money-order
offices in several places, with excellent results.</p>

<p>Sometimes it was Miss Nightingale herself who
wrote home to the soldier's family; sad, sweet letters,
telling how the husband or father had done his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
duty gallantly, and had died as a brave man should;
giving his last messages, and inclosing the mementos
he had left for them. To many a humble home
these letters brought comfort and support in the
hour of trial, and were treasured&mdash;are no doubt
treasured to this day&mdash;like the relics of a blessed
saint.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Peace was signed at Paris on
March 30, 1856, and now all hearts in the Crimea
turned toward home. One by one the hospitals were
closed, as their inmates recovered strength; one by
one the troopships were filled with soldiers&mdash;ragged,
gaunt, hollow-eyed, yet gay and light-hearted
as schoolboys&mdash;and started on the homeward voyage;
yet still the Lady-in-Chief lingered. Not
while one sick man remained would Florence Nightingale
leave her post. Indeed, at the last moment
she found a task that none but herself might have
taken up. The troopships were gone; but here, on
the camping ground before Sebastopol, were fifty
or sixty poor women, left behind when their husbands'
regiments had sailed, helpless and&mdash;I was
going to say friendless, but nothing could be more
untrue; for they gathered in their distress round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
hut of the Lady-in-Chief, imploring her aid; and she
soon had them on board a British ship, speeding
home after the rest.</p>

<p>And now the end had come, and there was only
one more thing to do, one more order to give; the
result of that last order is seen to-day by all who
visit that far-away land of the Crimea. On the
mountain heights above Balaklava, on a peak not
far from the Sanatorium where she labored and
suffered, towers a great cross of white marble, shining
like snow against the deep blue sky. This is the
"Nightingale Cross," her own tribute to the brave
men and the devoted nurses who died in the war.
At the foot of the cross are these words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lord have mercy upon us."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>To every Englishman&mdash;nay, to everyone of any
race who loves noble thoughts and noble deeds&mdash;this
monument will always be a sacred and a venerable
one.</p>

<p>In the spring of this year, Lord Ellesmere, speaking
before Parliament, said:</p>

<p>"My Lords, the agony of that time has become
a matter of history. The vegetation of two successive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
springs has obscured the vestiges of Balaklava
and of Inkerman. Strong voices now answer
to the roll call, and sturdy forms now cluster round
the colors. The ranks are full, the hospitals are
empty. The angel of mercy still lingers to the last
on the scene of her labors; but her mission is all
but accomplished. Those long arcades of Scutari,
in which dying men sat up to catch the sound of her
footstep or the flutter of her dress, and fell back
on the pillow content to have seen her shadow as it
passed, are now comparatively deserted. She may
be thinking how to escape, as best she may, on
her return, the demonstration of a nation's appreciation
of the deeds and motives of Florence Nightingale."</p>

<p>This was precisely what the Lady-in-Chief was
thinking. She meant to return to England as quietly
as she left it; and she succeeded. The British
Government begged her to accept a man-of-war as
her own for the time being; she was much obliged,
but would rather not. She went over to Scutari,
saw the final closing of the hospitals there, and took
a silent farewell of that place of many memories;
then stepped quietly on board a French vessel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
sailed for France. A few days later&mdash;so the story
goes&mdash;a lady quietly dressed in black, and closely
veiled, entered the back door of Lea Hurst. The
old butler saw the intruder, and hastened forward
to stop her way&mdash;and it was "Miss Florence!"</p>

<span class="small">THE TASKS OF PEACE.</span></h2>


<p>Now, the people of England had been on
tiptoe for some days with eagerness,
waiting to welcome the heroine of the
Crimea back to her native shores. They
would give her such a reception as no one had ever
yet had in that land of hospitality and welcomings.
She should have bells and cannon and bonfires, processions
and deputations and addresses&mdash;she should
have everything that anybody could think of.</p>

<p>When they found that their heroine had slipped
quietly through their fingers, as it were, and was
back in her own peaceful home once more, people
were sadly disappointed. They must give up the
cannon and the bonfires; but at least they might
have a glimpse of her! So hundreds of people
crowded the roads and lanes about Lea Hurst, waiting
and watching. An old lady living at the park
gate told Mrs. Tooley: "I remember the crowds as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
if it was yesterday. It took me all my time to answer
them. Folks came in carriages and on foot,
and there was titled people among them, and a lot
of soldiers, some of them without arms and legs,
who had been nursed by Miss Florence in the hospital,
and I remember one man who had been shot
through both eyes coming and asking to see Miss
Florence. But not ten out of the hundreds who
came got a glimpse of her. If they wanted help
about their pensions, they were told to put it down
in writing, and Miss Florence's maid came with an
answer. Of course she was willing to help everybody,
but it stood to reason she could not receive
them all; why, the park wouldn't have held all the
folks that came, and besides, the old Squire wouldn't
have his daughter made a staring stock of."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>After the first disappointment&mdash;which after all
was perfectly natural&mdash;all sensible people realized
how weary Miss Nightingale must be after her
tremendous labors, and how much she must need
rest. All who knew her, too, knew that she never
could abide public "demonstrations"; so they left
her in peace, and began sending her things, to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
their gratitude in a different way. The first gift of
this kind she had received before she left the Crimea,
from good Queen Victoria herself. This was "the
Nightingale Jewel," as it is called; "a ruby-red
enamel cross on a white field, encircled by a black
band with the words: 'Blessed are the merciful.'
The letters V. R.; surmounted by a crown in diamonds,
are impressed upon the centre of the cross.
Green enamel branches of palm, tipped with gold,
form the framework of the shield, while around
their stems is a riband of blue enamel, with the
single word 'Crimea.' On the top are three brilliant
stars of diamonds. On the back is an inscription
written by the Queen."</p>

<p>Another gift received on the scene of her labors
was a magnificent diamond bracelet sent her by the
Sultan of Turkey.</p>

<p>I do not know of any more jewels; but two gifts
that Miss Nightingale prized highly were a fine
case of cutlery sent her by the workmen of Sheffield,
each knife blade inscribed with the words "Presented
to Florence Nightingale, 1857," and the silver-bound
oak case inlaid with a representation of the
Good Samaritan; and a beautiful pearl-inlaid writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
desk, presented by her friends and neighbors
near Lea Hurst.</p>

<p>All these things were very touching; still more
touching were the letters that came from all over
the country, thanking and blessing her for all she
had done. Truly it was a happy home coming.</p>

<p>Miss Nightingale knew that she was very, very
weary; she realized that she must have a long rest,
but she little thought how long it must be. She,
and all her friends, thought that after a few months
she would be able to take up again the work she so
loved, and become the active leader in introducing
the new methods of nursing into England. But the
months passed, and grew from few to many, and
still her strength did not return. The next year,
indeed, when the dreadful Indian Mutiny broke out,
she wrote to her friend Lady Canning, wife of the
Governor-General of India, offering to come at
twenty-four hours' notice "if there was anything
to do in her line of business"; but Lady Canning
knew that she was not equal to such a task.</p>

<p>Slowly, gradually, the truth came to Florence
Nightingale: she was never going to be strong or
well again. Always delicate, the tremendous labors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of the Crimea had been too much for her. While
the work went on, the frail body answered the call
of the powerful will, the undaunted mind, the great
heart; now that the task was finished, it sank down
broken and exhausted. Truly, she had given her
life, as much as any soldier who fought and died in
the trenches or on the battlefield.</p>

<p>And what did she do when she finally came to
realize this? Did she give up, and say, "My work
on earth is done?" Not she! There may have been
some dark hours, but the world has never heard of
them. She never for an instant thought of giving
up her work; she simply changed the methods of
it. The poor tired body must stay in bed or on the
sofa; very well! But the mind was not tired at
all; the will was not weakened; the heart had not
ceased to throb with love and compassion for the
sick, the sorrowful, the suffering; the question was
to find the way in which they could work with as
little trouble as might be to their poor sick friend
the body.</p>

<p>The way was soon found. Whether at Lea Hurst
or in London (for she now spent a good deal of
time in the great city, to be near the centre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
things), her sick room became one of the busiest
places in all England.</p>

<p>Schemes for army reform, for hospital reform,
for reform in everything connected with the poor
and the sick&mdash;all these must be brought to Miss
Nightingale. All the soldiers in the country must
write to her whenever they wanted anything, from
a pension down to a wooden leg (to their honor
be it said, however, that though she was overwhelmed
with begging letters from all parts of the
country, not a soldier ever asked her for money).
The Nightingale fund, now nearly fifty thousand
pounds, was administered under her advice and direction,
and the first Training School for Nurses
organized and opened. The old incapable, ignorant
nurse vanished, and the modern nurse, educated,
methodical, clear-eyed and clear-headed, took her
place quietly; one of the great changes of modern
times was effected, and the hand that directed it
was the same one that we have seen holding the
lamp, or writing down the dying soldier's last words,
in the Barrack Hospital at Scutari.</p>

<p>That slender hand wrote books with all the rest
of its work. In the sick room as in the hospital,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Miss Nightingale had no time to waste. Her "Hospital
Notes" may be read to-day with the keenest
interest by all who care to know more of that great
story of the Crimean War; her "Notes on Nursing"
became the handbook of the Nursing Reform, and
ought to be in the hands of every nurse to-day as
it was in 1860, when it was written. Nor in the
hands of nurses only; I wish every girl and every
boy who reads this story would try to find that
slender, dingy volume in some library, and "read,
mark, learn, and inwardly digest" its contents.
They would know a good deal more than they do
now. Well might Miss Nightingale write, in 1861:
"I have passed the last four years between four
walls, only varied to other four walls once a year;
and I believe there is no prospect but of my health
becoming ever worse and worse till the hour of my
release. But I have never ceased, during one waking
hour since my return to England five years ago,
laboring for the welfare of the army at home, as I
did abroad, and no hour have I given to friendship
or amusement during that time, but all to work."</p>

<p>Drop a stone in the water and see how the circles
spread, growing wider and wider. After a while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
you cannot see them, but you know that the motion
you have started must go on and on till it whispers
against the pebbles on the farther shore. So it is
with a good deed or an evil one; we see its beginning;
we cannot see what distant shore it may reach.
So, no one will ever know the full amount of good
that this noble woman has done. The Sanitary
Commission of our own Civil War, the Red Cross
which to-day counts its workers by thousands in
every part of the civilized world, both owed their
first impulse to the pebble dropped by Florence
Nightingale&mdash;even her own life, given freely to suffering
humanity.</p>

<p>I have never seen, but I like to think of the quiet
room in London, where she lies to-day in the white
beauty of her age. Nearly ninety years have passed
since the little girl-baby woke to life among the
blossoms of the City of Flowers; more than half
a century has gone by since the Lady with the Lamp
passed like light along the corridors of the Barrack
Hospital; yet still Florence Nightingale lives and
loves, still her thoughts go out in tenderness and
compassion toward all who are "in trouble, sorrow,
need, sickness, or any other adversity."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us think of that quiet room as one of the holy
places of the earth; let us think of her, and take
our leave of her, with loving and thankful hearts.</p>

<h3>BY RALPH HENRY BARBOUR</h3>

<p><b>The New Boy at Hilltop</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Illustrated in Colors, Ornamental Cloth Cover with Inlay
in Colors, 12mo, $1.50.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The story of a boy's experiences at boarding school. The first
chapter describes his arrival and reception by the others. The remaining
chapters tell of his life on the football field, on the crew, his various
scrapes and fights, school customs and school entertainments. His
experiences are varied and cover nearly all the incidents of boarding
school life.</p></div>


<p><b>Winning His "Y"</b></p>

<p>Illustrated in Colors, 12mo, Decorated Cloth Cover, $1.50.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The scene of this story is Yardley Hall, the school made famous in
"Double Play" and "Forward Pass!"; and we meet again the manly,
self-reliant Dan Vinton, his young friend Gerald Pennimore, and many
others of the "old boys" whose athletic achievements and other doings
have been so entertainingly chronicled by Mr. Barbour. The new story
is thus slightly connected with its predecessors, but will be fully as interesting
to a boy who has not read them as if it were not.</p></div>


<p><b>Double Play</b></p>

<p>Illustrated in Colors, 12mo, Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Further experiences of Dan Vinton&mdash;hero of "Forward Pass!"&mdash;at
Yardley Hall. He becomes in a way the mentor of the millionaire's
son, Gerald Pennimore, who enters the school. There is the description
of an exciting baseball game, and the stratagem by which the wily
coach, Payson, puts some ginger into an overtrained squad and develops
from it a winning team will appeal to every boy.</p></div>


<p><b>Forward Pass!</b></p>

<p>Illustrated in Colors, 12mo, Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In his new story, Mr. Barbour returns to the field of his earlier
and more successful stories, such as "The Half-Back," "Captain of
the Crew," etc. The main interest in "Forward Pass!" centers about
the "new" football; the story is, nevertheless, one of preparatory-school
life and adventures in general. The book contains several
illustrations and a number of diagrams of the "new" football plays.
Mr. Barbour considers this his best story.</p></div>


<h3>BY WALTER CAMP</h3>


<p><b>Jack Hall at Yale</b></p>

<p>Illustrated in Colors, 12mo, Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>This is a story following, but not distinctly a sequel
to, Mr. Camp's successful juvenile, "The Substitute." It is
a story dealing principally with football in college, but including
rowing and other sports. Mr. Camp's idea in this book
is to give a little more of a picture of college life and the
relations, friendships, enmities, etc., of the students rather
than to tell nothing but a football story. In other words, the
book is more of an attempt at the "Tom Brown at Rugby"
idea than a purely athletic story, although the basis of the
story, as in "The Substitute," is still athletics.</p>


<p><b>The Substitute</b></p>

<p>Illustrated in Colors, 12mo, Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>It describes vividly the efforts of the coaches in "whipping"
the football team of a great university into shape for the
season's struggles. The whole story is completely realistic&mdash;the
talks of the coaches to the team; the discussion of points
and tactics in the game; the details of individual positions;
the daily work on the field.</p>

<p>Who can tell of Yale traditions, Yale ideals, and the
militant Yale spirit&mdash;which the famous author has marshaled
on a hundred football fields&mdash;as well as Walter Camp?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Those interested in the great college game of football will find
a most fascinating tale in 'The Substitute,' of which Walter Camp, the
well-known coach and authority on the game, is the author."&mdash;<i>Brooklyn
Eagle.</i></p></div>
